This is a wish list for protein folding and engineering. It contains some speculation and brain storming and shouldn't be considered completely viable for now.

# Wishlist

* DNA data storage: faster polymerases

* Proteins that make molecular display techniques easier (simplifying lab bench protocols) -- like mRNA display and ribosome display; easier molecular display would be very valuable for projects using directed evolution techniques.

* Better protein-based **nanopores** for DNA sequencing, amino acid sequencing, and protein sensing.

* Human-controlled DNA polymerase synthesis activity (choose each nucleotide), or an instrumented ribosome to control protein production regardless of mRNA content

* Molecular **protein lego**: connect multiple legos together to build large-scale protein structures. This is generally useful for modeling and nanostructures. Binding by DNA addresses or other high affinity ligand specific techniques, for a stable toolbox of known protein structures and shapes and building up larger structures from small parts.

* Protein **mechanical logic**: protein structures that have internal logic and state, based on mechanical motion or other catalytic reactions and interactions.

* Generalized, **fully-programmable molecular nanotechnology**: programmable nanomachines and nanofactories that can produce other nanostructures to exact specifications, without uncertainty regarding protein folding.

# TODO

* What were those long-tube protein molecular-chemistry factories called? They are apparently natural, and they have multiple points of interest inside the tube that modify a molecule as it progresses along the protein.

# Other interesting targets

* gene editing proteins (see [[gene-editing]])
* enzymes for DNA synthesis
* molecular recording (like in vivo DNA-based recording devices, for debugging or otherwise)
* protein binding affinity stuff ([protein-protein interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93protein_interaction)) 
* catalytic activity, enhancement of catalysis or reduction of catalysis
* synthetic metabolisms
* biosensors
