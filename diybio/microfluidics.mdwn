Microfluidic equipment relevant to homebrew biology, diybio, biohacking, etc.

# centrifugation

* DVD mount, run in DVD player
* food blender with custom chuck to hold slide

# electroporation

Sonoporation is probably the most simple for microfluidic designs.

# separation

* "Separation of lipids from blood utilizing ultrasonic standing waves in microfluidic channels"
* sound:
* * "Continuous particle separation in a microfluidic channel via standing surface acoustic waves (SSAW)"
* * "Noninvasive acoustic cell trapping in a microfluidic perfusion system for online bioassays"
* * "Chip integrated strategies for acoustic separation and manipulation of cells and particles"
* tangential flow filtration

## DNA separation

* pillar/post/peg array
* * Sometimes with an electric field
* * * "A DNA prism for high-speed continuous fractionation of large DNA molecules"
* * * "Separation of long DNA molecules by quartz nanopillar chips under a direct current electric field"
* jagged channel edge (see "Size-dependent free solution DNA electrophoresis in structured microfluidic systems")
* electrophoresis
* * "Electrophoretic separations on microfluidic chips"
* * capillary electrophoresis
* * capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE)
* * microchip-based capillary electrophoresis
* * pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
* * capillary zone electrophoresis
* * micelle electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC)
* * isoelectric focusing (IEF)
* * * isoelectric focusing also works for protein separation "Concentration and separation of proteins in microfluidic channels on the basis of transverse IEF"

## chromatography

The efficiency of chromatography increases with column length. Electrophoresis is often used in microfluidics instead of chromatography because "glass and plastics cannot withstand the pressures that would be needed; it is difficult to pack the channels without voids there are mass transfer problems in the corners of microchannels; voids cause unacceptable band broadening".

* hydrodynamic chromatography
* size exclusion chromatography
* "High-aspect-ratio, silicon oxide-enclosed pillar structures in microfluidic liquid chromatography"
* "Liquid phase chromatography on microchips"
* "Fabrication of high-quality microfluidic solid-phase chromatography columns"
* "Application of monoliths for bioparticle isolation"

## fractionation

* digital isoelectric fractionation (using separate pH-specific membranes based on isoelectric points of analytes)
* field flow fractionation
* nanochannels with step-size changes corresponding to lengths of particles to separate

# PCR

yep... many methods.

# DNA sequencing

not yet

# DNA synthesis

nope

# cell culture

sure

# pipettes

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipette#Microfluidic_pipette> (just kidding.. use a regular pipette?)

# thermometer

isn't this already microfluidic? or is it millifluidic?
