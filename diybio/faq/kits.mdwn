# Educational Kits - Intermediate (High school / Undergraduate College and above)

*Biotechnology DNA Extraction Kit: E. coli - DNA Extraction
*Biotechnology Kit: DNA Extraction of Micrococcus luteus
*AP Biology Lab 6: Molecular Biology - ''Green Gene Colony Transformation Kit'': "" Students observe the phenotypic effect of adding the gene for GFP (green fluorescent protein). GFP is expressed on plain LB - no color development substrate or induction reagent is needed. Your students can easily view the "green" effects in normal classroom lighting. Colonies will fluoresce under UV light.""

* [http://www.fralin.vt.edu/content/biotechinabox-equipment-loan-program Virginia Tech's Biotech in a Box]: ""DNA Biotechnology Kit contains the equipment and materials for students to pour agarose gels and use them to analyze DNA.  The Introduction to Immunology Kit contains background materials on basic immunology, with emphasis on using antibodies as tools in research and in diagnostic tests. The kit features a technique widely used in medicine, drug testing, and forensics: the ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbant Assay).  Column chromatography is a technique commonly used to purify proteins, both in research labs and in the biotechnology industry. The Column Chromatography Kit contains materials for running three types of chromatographic columns: gel filtration, which separates molecules by size; ion exchange, which separates based on charge; and reverse phase, which separates molecules based on polarity.  The Protein Electrophoresis Kit contains all of the material needed to perform polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of proteins.  ""
