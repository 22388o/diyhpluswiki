# Gene candidates for germline genetic modification

## Direct gene candidates


### CD47 suppression

gobs of radiation resistance. prevent binding of thrombospondin to CD47 with a drug, inhibits NO production and somehow this prevents radiation damage and kills cancer cells. antisense CD47 RNA should do the trick permanently.

Add better summary here

* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD47#Angiogenesis>

Other radiation resistance: "What about radiation resistance? Here's a case in the literature where radiation resistance was improved 100,000-fold. 10-fold using e14-deletion. 50-fold using recA. 20-fold using yfjK. And 10-fold using dnaB. See Ecoli, Byrne et al, eLife 2014 ("<a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e01322">Evolution of extreme resistance to ionizing radiation via genetic adaptation of DNA repair</a>"). This only requires 4 mutations. There is a wide variation in natural organisms, but the only difference here is those 4 mutations."

### Myostatin inhibition

There are a number of options here, but with germline modification, a muscle-specific knockout of ACVR2B or myostatin are good choices. Also follistatin overexpression in muscle.

### PEPCK-C overexpression

In muscle, this allows greatly improved metabolism and endurance (see 'mighty mice'). Synergistic effect with myostatin inhibition is untested, but intriguing.

### P53 overexpression

As the "guardian of the genome", p53 is missing in many cancers, and has been investigated as a gene therapy option for cancer. Introducing a separate copy, or copies of the gene from the wild-type could reduce the incidence of knockout mutations that normally lead to cancer.

### milano allele

"Apolipoprotein A-1 Milano (also ETC-216, now MDCO-216) (ApoA-1 milano) is a naturally occurring mutated variant of the apolipoprotein A1 protein found in human HDL, the lipoprotein particle that carries cholesterol from tissues to the liver and is associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. ApoA1 Milano was first identified by Dr. Cesare Sirtori in Milan, who also demonstrated that its presence significantly reduced cardiovascular disease, even though it caused a reduction in HDL levels and an increase in triglyceride levels."

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ApoA-1_Milano>

### Alpha-galactosidase expression

Humans are unsuited to digesting some types of branching carbohydrates, which then pass through the intestines and feed annoying bacteria. Not a huge priority, but with the increased metabolic demands from the muscle-enhancing therapies, it can't hurt.

### CCR5 knockout

Provides resistance to HIV and plague. Increases risk from West Nile virus, but who gives a fuck about that.

Also see HCP5 (rs2395029), and CCL3L1.

### Lactase persistence (lactose tolerance)

<http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4988235>
<http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4988235(C;C)>

Also known as "C/T(-13910)", and located in the MCM6 gene but with influence on the lactase LCT gene, rs4988235 is one of two SNPs that is associated with the primary haplotype associated with hypolactasia, more commonly known as lactose intolerance in European Caucasian populations. [PMID 11788828], [PMID 15114531]

In these populations, the rs4988235(T) allele is both the more common allele and the one associated with lactase persistence; individuals who are rs4988235(C;C) are likely to be lactose intolerant. In populations of sub-Saharan Africans, though, the rs4988235(T) allele is so rare that it's unlikely to be predictive of lactase persistence, and other SNPs are predictive instead.

## Theoretical "heterozygote advantages" genes

The principle here is that diseases such as sickle cell or Tay-Sachs, among many others, persist in a population because having one 'good' and one 'bad' copy of the gene offers a significant advantage - in disease resistance, intelligence, etc.

While it would be nice to find a point mutation that would mimic the benefits of heterozygosity, the most straightforward option would be to give someone both variants of the gene, with ~50% expression of each.

## Skin

Albinism is probably the easiest way to go here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocutaneous_albinism#Types">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocutaneous_albinism#Types</a>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo#Causes">Vitiligo</a> seems to be related to a mutation in tyrosinase (TYR), similar to albinism. In vitiligo, there is a destruction of melanocytes.

melanosome transfer disorder, creating localized spots of depigmentation - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus_depigmentosus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus_depigmentosus</a>

"Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the skin color of darker-skinned humans. The skin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis. Humans with naturally occurring light skin have varied amounts of smaller and scarcely distributed eumelanin and its lighter-coloured relative, pheomelanin. The concentration of pheomelanin varies highly within populations from individual to individual, but it is more commonly found among East Asians, Native Americans, and Northern Europeans with red hair."

"Organelles which contain pigments, called melanosomes, are smaller and less numerous in light-skinned humans."

* "Inhibition of melanosome transfer results in skin lightening" <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15409418">ref</a>
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism#Genetics">albinism genetics</a> - OCA1, OCA2; "A mutation in the human TRP-1 gene may result in the deregulation of melanocyte tyrosinase enzymes, a change that is hypothesized to promote brown versus black melanin synthesis."

"Variations in the KITL gene have been positively associated with about 20% of melanin concentration differences between African and non-African populations. One of the alleles of the gene has an 80% occurrence rate in Eurasian populations. The ASIP gene has a 75–80% variation rate among Eurasian populations compared to 20–25% in African populations. Variations in the SLC24A5 gene account for 20–25% of the variation between dark and light skinned populations of Africa, and appear to have arisen as recently as within the last 10,000 years. The Ala111Thr or rs1426654 polymorphism in the coding region of the SLC24A5 gene reaches fixation in Europe, but is found across the globe, particularly among populations in Northern Africa, the Horn of Africa, West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Whilst not all of these genes directly affect melanin production, most of them code for proteins that may play a significant role in melanogenesis and control melanin concentration. Some of these genes are found to be more prevalent in certain population than others."

"The characteristic of fair skin, red hair, and freckling is associated with high amount of pheomelanin, little amounts of eumelanin. This phenotype is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. However, variations in the MC1R gene sequence only have considerable influence on pigmentation in populations where red hair and extremely fair skin is prevalent. The gene variation’s primary effect is to promote eumelanin synthesis at the expense of pheomelanin synthesis, although this contributes to very little variation in skin reflectance between different ethnic groups. Melanocytes from light skin cells cocultured with keratinocytes give rise to a distribution pattern characteristic of light skin."

We focus on melanosome biogenesis, transport and transfer, melanogenic regulators in melanocytes and factors derived from keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, hormones, inflammatory cells and nerves. Enzymatic components of melanosomes include tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 and dopachrome tautomerase, which depend on the functions of OA1, P, MATP, ATP7A and BLOC-1 to synthesize eumelanins and pheomelanins. The main structural component of melanosomes is Pmel17/gp100/Silv, whose sorting involves adaptor protein 1A (AP1A), AP1B, AP2 and spectrin, as well as a chaperone-like component, MART-1. During their maturation, melanosomes move from the perinuclear area toward the plasma membrane. Microtubules, dynein, kinesin, actin filaments, Rab27a, melanophilin, myosin Va and Slp2-a are involved in melanosome transport. Foxn1 and p53 up-regulate skin pigmentation via bFGF and POMC derivatives including α-MSH and ACTH, respectively. Other critical factors that affect skin pigmentation include MC1R, CREB, ASP, MITF, PAX3, SOX9/10, LEF-1/TCF, PAR-2, DKK1, SCF, HGF, GM-CSF, endothelin-1, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, neurotrophins and neuropeptides. UV radiation up-regulates most factors that increase melanogenesis. Further studies will elucidate the currently unknown functions of many other pigment genes/proteins."

"Both TET2 and DNMT3A are factors [28,29] and are thought to silence hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal to permit efficient hematopoietic differentiation [30,31]. Therefore, loss of functionality in these genes is likely to underlie an enhanced self-renewal leading to the observed age-related myeloid lineage bias. This skewing towards the myeloid lineage is assumed to have adverse effects on immune functionality in normal healthy individuals, but in the oldest old the increase of the myeloid compartment might be compensative for the age-related decrease in naive T-cells, known as immuno-senescence. Hence on condition that the enhanced self-renewal, instigated by somatic disruptive mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A, leads to increased levels of competent immune cells, be it of the myeloid lineage though, might partly compensate for the age-related loss of immuno-capacity of the lymphoid compartment."

## Other notes

Tetracycline response elements, i.e. tet-on and tet-off, can be used for transgenes where constant expression is undesirable. While a number of options for such inducible expression exist, the tet system is the most studied. It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine which genes would be suitable candidates [I will add some when I get around to it].

* "Genetic variants influencing the human chorionic gonadotrophin hormone, serotonin and autoimmune functioning have been proposed as candidates for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP). It has also been proposed that there is a higher frequency of severe NVP in patients with disorders in taste sensation, in the glycoprotein hormone receptor or in fatty acid transport." from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/2/e17/2617151/Cohort-Profile-Nausea-and-vomiting-during">ref</a>

## Microbiome

### dental caries vaccine

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caries_vaccine)

a genetically modified strain of Streptococcus mutans called BCS3-L1, is incapable of producing lactic acid, which dissolves tooth enamel, and aggressively replaces native flora. In laboratory tests, rats who were given BCS3-L1 were conferred with a lifetime of protection against S. mutans.
Dr. Jeffrey D. Hillman suggests that treatment with BCS3-L1 in humans could also provide a lifetime of protection, or, at worst, require occasional re-applications. He figures the treatment would be available in dentists' offices and "will probably cost less than $100.
