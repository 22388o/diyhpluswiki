"Noladex should be taken when one is holding too much water during a cycle."

"For someone starting on steroids, make sure he is taking the ones that are very mild on the body like Anavar and a little testosterone. Take the minimum dosages and the cycle should be as brief as possible - about 4-6 weeks - before following an off cycle. If injecting, make sure to get a doctor to do it - it can be done as a matter of course in some countries - to ensure cleanliness and safety."

"most testosterone i have ever taken is 1,250mg a week and this is considered nothing since I am a pro."

"I would normally stay on a cycle for 12 weeks. I increase my dosage and taper off. The best thing is to increase the dosage slowly for the body to adapt, and taper off slowly to keep the gains obtained from the cycle. That is the strategy that works best for me."

"I do off cycle for health purposes, and to get bigger physically in the long run. Off cycles are needed for the body to reproduce its own testosterone - endogenous testosterone will be shut down during a steroid cycle when testosterone is taken - and to give the liver and other organs in my body a "break". An off cycle is also important to prevent receptor saturation. This usually occurs if a cycle is taken for a long period of time. When the receptors are "free," they will respond better to steroids in a new cycle. "

"When I am on a cycle, I am a lot stronger. Hence, I train as heavy as possible, but with good form. Also, I train six days a week because when I am on a cycle it is less likely I will overtrain. On an off cycle I will train lighter and do four days a week routine."

"Since I started my first cycle I have gained about 40lbs of pure muscle - all this in the space of nine years. In my first contest I weighed 180lbs and at my last pro show I came in at 220lbs. Beside that I have been a lot stronger too. I kept most of my gains (muscle and strength) when I was on an off cycle."

"I do medical checkups every four to five months and so far my health is excellent. The only side effect I have when I am on the juice is acne on my face and shoulders. I usually take antibiotic such as Accutane to treat this problem."
