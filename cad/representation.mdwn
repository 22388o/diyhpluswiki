Question: what is a good general-purpose CAD representation format?

If you have high-resolution constraints and very particular surfaces with particular curves, then it seems wrong to represent them as a collection of fine-grained triangles especially if the triangles don't actually correspond to the desired curvature.

# Representation formats

* implicitcad f-reps ? these might be two separate techniques.
* tessellated polyhedral triangle meshes
* NURBS
* b-splines
* bezier curves
* CSG boolean representation (unevaluated)

# Edge cases

* high-resolution, smooth surface with particular exact shape that must be transmitted to the CAM/CNC tool with certain specifications
* intersection of high-resolution curves between two surfaces
