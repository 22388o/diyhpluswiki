Users who plan to contribute often are encouraged to seek out better IRC clients. The channel inhabitants seem to like [irssi](http://irssi.org/), [ChatZilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/) for Firefox, [Textual](http://codeux.com/textual/) for OS X, [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/), [XChat](http://xchat.org/), and a variety of bouncers and remote shells.
