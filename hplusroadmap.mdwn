The \#\#[[hplusroadmap]] IRC channel on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net/) is the longest-lived Internet Relay Chat channel for do-it-yourself biohacking and practical transhumanism. It features over 4 years of [public logs](http://gnusha.org/logs).

Users unfamiliar with IRC might find it helpful to connect through the Freenode webchat client: <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23hplusroadmap>

Users who plan to contribute often are encouraged to seek out better IRC clients. The channel inhabitants seem to like irssi, textual, xchat, and a variety of bouncers.
