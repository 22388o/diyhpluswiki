# What is hplusroadmap?

The #hplusroadmap IRC channel is a technology development and engineering group that focuses on projects such as:

* [DNA synthesis](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/dna/synthesis/notes/) machine development
* brain emulation, brain uploading, computational neuroscience
* nootropics
* do-it-yourself biology, genetic engineering, gene therapy, biohacking, synthetic biology
* cryonics
* molecular nanotechnology
* molecular biology, polymerase, enzyme engineering, protein engineering, fusion proteins, directed evolution, <a href="http://diyhpl.us/wiki/gene-editing">gene-editing</a>
* open-source hardware development
* self-replicating machines
* robots, mechanical automation, machining, electronics
* space colonization, habitats, mining, communication, transportation
* nutrition, bodybuilding
* computer architecture, supercomputing
* open-source software development
* transhumanism
* life extension, anti-aging, longevity research
* cryptography, bitcoin technology development

# Logs

All logs are stored at <http://gnusha.org/logs> and are instantly updated after receiving new messages. Strangely, [sorting by log size per day](http://gnusha.org/logs/?C=S;O=D) returns relatively high-signal content, so this is an interesting way to binge on historical hplusroadmap data.

There may be a disruption to logging as we transition to [libera.chat](http://libera.chat). Please pardon the dust.

# Connecting to IRC

-    download and run an [IRC client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients)
-    /connect irc.libera.chat
-    /join #hplusroadmap

There is not a web chat interface available for libera yet.

Users who plan to contribute often are encouraged to seek out better IRC clients. The channel inhabitants seem to like [irssi](http://irssi.org/), [ChatZilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/) for Firefox, [Textual](http://codeux.com/textual/) for OS X, [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/), [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io), and a variety of bouncers and remote shells.


# Projects

There's some funding available for hplusroadmap projects.

# History

The hplusroadmap IRC channel was started in 2008 to focus on a roadmap for transhumanist technology development, do-it-yourself biohacking and turning near-future ideas into practical engineering projects.

The channel was hosted on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) until 2021-05-19, when a hostile takeover of the network led us to move to [libera.chat](http://libera.chat).


# Rules

* no philosophy (violators that are bad at philosophy will be harshly judged)
