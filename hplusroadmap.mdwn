# What is hplusroadmap?

The ##hplusroadmap IRC channel is a technology development and engineering group that focuses on projects such as:

* [DNA synthesis](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/dna/synthesis/notes/) machine development
* brain emulation, brain uploading, computational neuroscience
* nootropics
* do-it-yourself biology, genetic engineering, gene therapy, biohacking, synthetic biology
* cryonics
* molecular nanotechnology
* molecular biology, polymerase, enzyme engineering, protein engineering, fusion proteins, directed evolution, [gene editing](/gene-editing)
* open-source hardware development
* self-replicating machines
* robots, mechanical automation, machining, electronics
* space colonization, habitats, mining, communication, transportation
* nutrition, bodybuilding
* computer architecture, supercomputing
* open-source software development
* transhumanism
* life extension, anti-aging, longevity research
* cryptography, bitcoin technology development

# Logs

All logs are stored at <http://gnusha.org/logs> and are instantly updated after receiving new messages. Strangely, [sorting by log size per day](http://gnusha.org/logs/?C=S;O=D) returns relatively high-signal content, so this is an interesting way to binge on historical hplusroadmap data.

# Connecting to IRC

    /connect irc.freenode.net
    /join ##hplusroadmap

Users unfamiliar with IRC might find it helpful to connect through the Freenode webchat client: <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23hplusroadmap>

Users who plan to contribute often are encouraged to seek out better IRC clients. The channel inhabitants seem to like [irssi](http://irssi.org/), [ChatZilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/) for Firefox, [Textual](http://codeux.com/textual/) for OS X, [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/), [XChat](http://xchat.org/), and a variety of bouncers and remote shells.

The channel is hosted on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/).

# Projects

There's some funding available for hplusroadmap projects.

# History

The hplusroadmap IRC channel was started in 2008 to focus on a roadmap for transhumanist technology development, do-it-yourself biohacking and turning near-future ideas into practical engineering projects.

# Rules

* no philosophy (violators that are bad at philosophy will be harshly judged)
