= What is DIYbio, as an organization? =
DIYbio is an organization that aims to help make biology a worthwhile pursuit for citizen scientists, amateur biologists, and DIY biological engineers who value openness and safety. This will require mechanisms for amateurs to increase their knowledge and skills, access to a community of experts, the development of a code of ethics, responsible oversight, and leadership on issues that are unique to doing biology outside of traditional professional settings.


DIYbio is a distributed community of amateur or professional biologists, industry professional or amateur engineers, biomedical engineers, life scientists, computer scientists, etc. Our activities range across a broad spectrum, from molecular naturalism (sequencing part of your own genome or bacterial populations) to biological engineering to building low-cost, open-source alternative lab equipment (Gel Box 2.0) to writing open source software for biology, to creating open source hardware systems and manufacturing.

== What is DIYbio's mission? ==
== Are we moving to a future where everyone performs a little genetic engineering? Is genetic engineering safe?  Are GMO's safe?  Is genetic engineering safe for hackers or everyone to perform?  Aren't there too many risks or unknowns? ==

Today, everyone performs a "little" computer use, whereas decades ago leaders in the computer field claimed regular people would never need a computer.  Decades before that, leaders in the transportation field claimed regular people would never need a car or would never need high speed travel.  Eventually these technologies became usable enough for everyone, and somewhat indispensable.  ''Looking many decades ahead, genetic engineering will likely be a common place activity, as with any technology.''

Regarding whether genetic engineering is safe for hackers or for everyone:

* There are many unknowns in genetic engineering ("We don't know").

* There are many more unknowns than we currently know are unknown ("We don't know what we don't know").

* There are methods to contain genetic engineering experiments to a clean laboratory with only small amounts of risk ("We can reduce the possibility of problems during experimentation").

* There are unknown risks if genetic engineering experiments escape into the wild ("We don't know").

'''Readers are encouraged to check out [http://www.macrovu.com/image/GMimg/infoMrlUnknwnsInGMv7.pdf "What we know--and what we don't know--about ecological risks of genetically engineered plants" as of 2001] knowledge map on risk from [http://www.stanford.edu/~rhorn/ Robert Horn at Stanford].'''

* Open-Source Biology And Its Impact on Industry, Rob Carlson,  IEEE Spectrum, 2001. 
::""Technology based on intentional, open-source biology is on its way, whether we like it or not. Distributed biological manufacturing is the future of the global economy and will occur as inexpensive, quality DNA sequencing and synthesis equipment becomes available to anyone. In 2050, garage biology hacking will be well under way. Fear of potential hazards should be met with increased research and education, rather than closing the door on the profound positive impacts that distributed biological technology will have on human health, human impacts on the environment, and increasing standards of living around the world.

:: ""[..] more and more people outside the traditional biotechnology community will create self-replicating machines (life) for civil and defence applications, ‘‘bio-hackers’’ will engineer new life forms at their kitchen table; and illicit substances will be produced synthetically and much cheaper. Such a scenario is a messy and dangerous one, and we need to think about appropriate safety standards now. ""

:: ""Suggestions have also been made for dealing with biosafety issues to do with the accidental (rather than purposeful) release of synthetic organisms. Tucker and Zilinskas (2006), for example, think that the precautionary principle should be adopted with respect to synthetic biology saying that ''it may be necessary to ban all uses in the open environment until a robust risk assessment can be conducted for each proposed application'' (p.44). Others think that this step would make research expensive and restrict synthetic biology to a few labs (Garfinkel et al. 2007). ""



=== What are the social, ethical, legal/patent implications of DIY Bio or home genetic engineering? How might it be best to create more social, ethical, legal/patent discussion? ===

These issues are discussed very well in the publications of SYNBIOSAFE, which includes discussion of DIYbio itself.

::""A code of ethics and standards should emerge for biological engineering as it has done forother engineering disciplines. [...] Above all, outreach is required. Genetically modified products, including crops and gene-therapy drugs, have been opposed for reasons that go beyond worries about scientific uncertainties. Citizens who will gladly take recombinant-DNA drugs (such as interferon, insulinand erythropoietin) are reluctant to eat foods containing even trace amounts of recombinant DNA. Can synthetic biology gain greater public trust? We should learn from past cases; in the case of foods generated by synthetic biology, for example, we need to recognize that stakeholders include not just the farmers, but their neighbours and grocery shoppers also. [...] In addition to a code of professional ethics for synthetic biologists, we need to watch for the rare cases when they transgress. This requires not just laws, but also monitoring compliance. [..] Discussions about this have begun, including one funded by the Sloan Foundation ('Study to explore risks, benefits of synthetic genomics').  But any actions that penalize the legitimate manufacturer or user are likely to backfire, and having laws without government-mandated surveillance will be ineffective.   Finally, the community needs to discuss the benefits of synthetic engineering to balance the necessary, but distracting, focus on risks.  From now on, each small step towards engineering enzymatic pathways for cheaper pharmaceuticals, smart biomaterials and large-scale integrated genetic circuits should be celebrated. ""

== How can I find out more and contribute? ==
Many ways! Here's a brief overview:

* IRC (#diybio on irc.freenode.net)
* local groups

So far, we mainly communicate through the [http://groups.google.com/group/diybio mailing list]. There is also a lower volume [http://groups.google.com/group/diybio-announce DIYbio announce] mailing list, which occassionally has announcements that the community might be interested in. Also, there are groups for:

== What are the Guidelines for Posting to the DIYBio mailing lists and/or Forums? ==

''As the DIYBio mailing list membership grows, it is more important to follow good guidelines for easier readability within discussions.''  This is called ''Netiquette.''

Please:

* Follow proper quoting rules:
<pre>
 One should reply using the standard technique:

    User C. wrote:
    > User B. wrote:
    > > User A. wrote:
    > > > blablabla
    > > blubberblubber
    > laberlaber 
</pre>

For complete information see [http://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html conventional netiquette].
* When quoting another author, keep the attribution line ("On such-and-such-date, Jonathan Cline wrote:").
** Delete portions of the paragraph which do not pertain to the new reply.  This is known as ''Trimming the post''.  
** Trim all quoted text to be the minimum necessary to follow the discussion.
*** Replace deleted text with "[...]" if it changes the placement of words or sentences in a paragraph.
* ''Add your message below any quoted text.  This means "write your reply at the bottom".''
**Do not "top post".  "Top posting" is when the reply is added above the quoted text.  This is not as easy to read wen there are many replies in a thread.  For this reason, do not "top post", only add the reply at the ''bottom''.  Many mail programs have a setting to "reply at top" or "reply at bottom" -- always set it to "Reply at bottom" or manually perform this action yourself.  "Top posting" is considered rude by many readers.
*Change the '''Subject''' when the topic changes.

Please see the following Internet reference for complete information:

== What is open source hardware? ==


http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_source_hardware

"Open Source Hardware is hardware that keeps its designs available in a way similar to the open source in software." There is no defacto license for open source hardware yet. Some websites (like ponoko, thingiverse, unptnt) put hardware CAD files under a "Creative Commons" license. However, it's still unknown how this is likely to interface with the legal systems around the world (i.e., patents). And it's not necessarily true that putting something directly into the [http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/04/1338228 public domain] is the best way to go either. So, the future is presently unclear- in terms of legal issues. 

DIYbio has many big supporters of standardized packaging formats (like .tar.gz, .deb, .tar, .rpm, etc.) for automatic downloading of hardware components and instructions on how to build the components. There are some sites that almost implement this (but not quite) such as [http://instructables.com instructables], [http://ponoko.com ponoko], [http://thingiverse.com/ thingiverse], odesigns, [http://unptnt.com/ unptnt], etc.
