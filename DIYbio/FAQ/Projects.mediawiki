= Project Ideas =

The following are project ideas (brainstorming) which have been discussed on DIYbio google group.  Research papers or existing products similar to these ideas can be found, with the DIYbio aspect of lowering the cost, open sourcing the design, and allowing latest technology (such as USB or network, for electronics devices) to be added as enhancements.

* Comparing various inexpensive reagents to the purified commercial counterparts; for example, food-grade agar-agars to commercial agaroses.

* Using LEDs as spectrophotometer, colorimeter, etc.  Some projects already exist around the web.

* Using USB/networkable microcontrollers for thermocyclers.

* Fabricating microfluidic devices and using USB microcontrollers for microfluidics (pump/valve/syringe) control.

* Printing, patterning, synthesizing various substances or microbes with inkjet printers.  Modifying gene expression with inkjet dispensing.
** Several other fields are also very engaged in modifying inkjet printers:  for making electronics circuit boards (inkjet PCB); for making physical objects (inkjet fabrication), for printing on objects (inkjet handhelds).   Check these projects for how to modify inkjet printers for Bio projects as well.

== For Algae ==

* A Photo Bio Reactor (PBR)  is a system that provides an artificial environment for photosynthetic organisms (Algae) to perform a chemical conversion. Scientists and engineers have been developing several types of photo-bio reactors (PBR’s) over the past fifty years to grow microorganisms that are used in a wide variety of applications. Cultivated algae cultures can be used to produce human food, animal feed, health food, therapeutics, chemicals, fuel, hormones, and fertilizer.  A prototype PBR was built at SDSU in 1998 that had a reactor capacity of 1 gallon.  The prototype was inoculated with algae obtain from Argonne National Laboratory and produced an algae biomass in excess of 25g.  The success of the prototype led to the decision to scale up the prototype PBR to capacity of 500 gallons.  The 500 gallon PBR is large enough to study the feasibility of commercial production algae.  In the summer of 2000 research was initiated to evaluate the feasibility of scaling up the prototype PBR.  Research revealed that little is known quantitatively about how the different subsystems interact and affect algal biomass production in PBR.  The scaled up PBR design was then modified to allow for the testing of the effect the different subsystems have on algal biomass production independently as well as interactions of the subsystems.   Test variables may be light type (wavelength), intensity of light, mixing intensity, nutrient requirements, control strategies, etc.  http://abe.sdstate.edu/faculty/garyanderson/website/pbr_home.html

* An Algae Bioreactor from Recycled Water Bottles.  In this instructable, we describe how to build a photo-bioreactor that uses algae to convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into energy. The energy that is produced is in the form of algae biomass. The photo-bioreactor is built from plastic recycled water bottles. By designing the apparatus to be compartmentalized, we are able to do many experiments in parallel.  http://www.instructables.com/id/An_Algae_Bioreactor_from_Recycled_Water_Bottles/

* I got interested in the idea of growing Spirulina at home after I obtained a breeding pair of Bristlenose Pleco’s.  What better food source than fresh Spirulina, I thought to myself.  I wondered around Google for days, which turned into weeks, then months.  No where could I find a single source that could easily explain how to grow Spirulina at home.  If you are interested in growing Spirulina at home, I hope you find this method useful. I’ll give you a quick run down of my version of “Growing Tubes”, both in expensive and easy to build in a day.  I went to Home Depot....   http://gpasi.org/forums/index.php?topic=64.0

* In-Home Photosynthetic Bioreactor - 1997-98. Invented by Lee Robinson, the founder of the British biotechnological company Biotechna, the Biocoil is a "photosynthetic bioreactor that provides an environment for biological organism to grow in a controlled manner."   The frame is built and clear PVC tubing is wrapped around it to form a circular model so that it is easier for photosynthesis to occur. Sunlight or artificial light is then put in at an angle to shine on the tubing while the algae flows through. Chlorella algae was used in the Sewage Sister Biocoil to remove nutrients from the sewage flowing along with the algae. The tubing of the Biocoil consists of several sections of tubing rather than one piece wrapped all of the way around. Compressed air pumps are used to push the algae and water through the Biocoil and to prevent anoxic conditions in the water. http://web.archive.org/web/20071009122237/http://advbio.cascadeschools.org/97-98/minicoil.html
:: The Biocoil Operations Manual (The Trip From the Algae's Point of View).  The Biocoil is a tertiary sewage treatment system which utilizes light and algae to remove phosphates and nitrates from secondary effluent. The Biocoil is a round unit eight feet tall and six of those feet are surrounded by 1600 feet of clear one inch inside diameter food grade tubing. This tubing is exposed to light 24 hours a day, either by natural sunlight or artificial light. The inside of the Biocoil is composed of three tanks, the contact, holding, and settling tank. The manifold which distributes water from the tanks to the tubes is also located inside the Biocoil.  http://web.archive.org/web/20070520071350/advbio.cascadeschools.org/95-96/biomanual.html

=== Basics of Growing Algae ===

"How to get started growing algae at home."

Needed:

*a space that can be easily heated or cooled depending on the weather.
*cool white flourescent lights 35-40 watts.
*aquarium aereation pump. tubing, and airstones... tees(all this from walmart.)
*shelves depending on how many cultures you want to grow
*glass jars one quart, and one gallon for as  many cultures as you plan to grow
*aquarium sea salts (Instant ocean) I cup per gallon of distilled water.
*dial thermometers
*graduated measuring cups
*Ph. papers
*Nutrient solution
*algae cultures( often come in 50 ml tubes )
*growing instructions come with the cultures.

Setup:

*when you receive the culture add the contents of the tube to 250 ml of water (salt or fresh)
*keep lights on 24/7
*keep aereation on 24/7
*once the 250 ml turns green add another 250 ml and so on untill you have a liter of green algae
*take the green  liter and add it to a gallonglass jar,
* once you have a gallon you can seed a ten gallon aquarium or you can add the gallon to larger tanks or  to  a closed loop ecosystem
*and in  two weeks, voila! youll have algae growing.
*unenclosed ponds are unstable and prone to contamination by outside influences such as acid rain, water fowl that carry  wild algae on thier feathers , animals , temperature variations.windbourne pollutants. night time temperature variations.etc

Bob's Homemade Shaking Incubator Design

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my design for an easy-to-build and inexpensive laboratory
shaker/shaking incubator. It will undoubtedly remind many readers of
something they may have built for the Science Fair in the 5th grade, but
as far as I know, the use of record-player power and the hanging
platform are original. And, hey, you can't argue with the price.

Three figures are attached. The attachments are MIME-encoded, and should
be decodable with any MIME-compliant newsreader, including the one built
into NetScape 2.0. The figures are small, black and white drawings in
GIF format, and should be viewable from any web browser, once they are
decoded.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shaking platform is cut from a particleboard sheet the same size as
the top of the box; the rest of the sheet is used to reinforce the top
of the box. The platform is suspended from the edge of the top opening
with strings. Slipknots are used in the strings to make them easy to
adjust until the platform is more-or-less level. Then the knots are
secured in place with tape. The strings and holes are arranged so that
the strings hang as vertically (i.e., parallel to one another) as
possible. This way the platform will remain essentially level as it
swings around in a circle.

A bolt is mounted on the turntable, and passed through a hole in the
platform, so that when the turntable spins, the shaker moves in an
orbital motion. Note that it takes very little work on the part of the
record palyer motor to move the platform in a horizontal circle, even if
it carries significant weight.

The heat source (light bulb), fan, and thermostat are mounted on a
particleboard base, and wired so that the fan is always on, but the
light bulb is turned on and off by the thermostat in classic Jr. High
School Science Fair fashion. The whole heat-control unit is placed in
the incubator box, and a thermometer is used to calibrate the
thermostat. The thermostat I use keeps the box somewhere 35 and 38
degrees centigrade. I think a regular home thermostat would work better,
but the bugs don't seem to mind.

The fan blows air around fast enough that air in the whole box is very
close to the same temperature. But I put the thermostat probe behind the
fan so it would not detect radiant heat, and the light is below the
platform so it doesn't shine right on the cultures.

I covered the areas of the cardboard walls and the portion of the bottom
of the platform that come close to the light bulb with foil, to reflect
some heat so they wouldn't be quite as likely to catch fire. If you fold
several thicknesses of slightly wrinkled foil together, they make a nice
shield against radiant heating (this was the suggestion of Mike Herron,
from the lab across the hall).

The box is sealed with masking tape, except for the top opening. A lid
(not shown) is made of an additional cardboard sheet, edged with soft
foam weather stripping. This type of flat lid limits the height of
culture flasks to the distance between the shaking platform and the top
of the box; alternatively, a raised lid made of a second box would allow
more room.

This shaker has three speeds; 33, 45, and 78 rpm. The fastest setting is
still somewhat slower than typical bacterial culture conditions, but it
works OK if you leave plenty of air in your flasks. A faster motor could
be substituted for the record player, but it wouldn't be as cute.

The heating unit and the record player can both be plugged into a power
strip, so a single convenient switch can be used to turn the whole thing
on and off.

The tools required are fairly simple:

* wrench, pliers, screwdriver, etc. to remove any parts of the record
player that stick up too high.

* drill to mount the bolt on the turntable, and make holes for the
strings.

* knife to cut cardboard and strip insulation on the wires.

* jigsaw to cut the platform from the particleboard.

My estimate of the cost of materials is as follows:

* cardboard box, string, tape, etc.: $0.00

* record player: $0.75 (yes, I can get them in Minneapolis for 75 cents
at the "Digger's Delight" behind Goodwill on Como Avenue near Highway
280. Otherwise they may run you 5 bucks apiece at a garage sale).

* thermostat: $3.50 from AxMan surplus, University Ave., St. Paul. At a
hardware store, these cost about $12.

* fan: $7.50. I used a 120V AC box fan, about 4 inches in diameter
(AxMan Surplus). I couldn't find one the right size at Digger's, but
keep your eyes peeled.

* light socket: $0.85 (hardware store)

* weather stripping: ~$3

* power strip: ~$3.50 (only used for the Shaker Deluxe). 

* thermometer: $1.19

*I scrounged the light bulb and the particleboard. (Retail ~$3?)  

So I have over $20 invested in my shaking incubator, and it could easily cost over $23 if you had to buy particleboard and stuff. Old record players also make great sample rotators, if you set them at a steep angle, or they can be used to wash gels and blots, if you put your pan on the turntable and slightly raise one end of the record player. The only shaking incubator I have in my current lab is of this design (serial number 00000001). I have used it to grow 50 ml E. coli cultures in LB, in regular 500ml Erlenmeyers, and 1.5ml cultures in TB in 15 ml snap-cap tubes. I have recently used this incubator to clone a cDNA sequence for a novel human neurotransmitter receptor subunit. But I'll try not to let Real Science interfere too much with inventin' stuff. :)

Happy shakin'!

From: Cathal <cathalgar...@gmail.com>
Date: Sep 17, 10:07 am

I've just published my first designs on Shapeways, for a $100 Gel Boat
and Comb set.
Sit these into a plastic container with some graphite electrodes at
either end, and you have a complete gel electrophoresis kit.
I intend to make more designs and share them both on this shop and
with the open-source community in the near future!

http://www.shapeways.com/shops/labsfromfabs

The designs are open source, and are available on Thingiverse.com for
those with access to a 3D printer.. just be sure and let me know the
results please! I'm awaiting my own 3D printer right now so I'm
itching to see results.

Note: Because of the opaque nature of the printed plastic, UV
visualisation will have to be Top-down.

* THE MACGYVER PROJECT: GENOMIC DNA EXTRACTION AND GEL ELECTROPHORESIS EXPERIMENTS USING EVERYDAY MATERIALS.  By Yas Shirazu, Donna Lee, and Esther Abd-Elmessih.  DNA extraction and separation by agarose gel electrophoresis is a simple and exciting process that anyone can perform. However, the high cost of specialized equipment and chemicals often hinder such an experiment from being carried by members of the high school community. Here, we describe a cost effective way of extracting and electrophoresing DNA under a prescribed MacGyver limitation – that is using only materials available from a grocery store or shopping mall.  http://www.scq.ubc.ca/the-macgyver-project-genomic-dna-extraction-and-gel-electrophoresis-experiments-using-everyday-materials/

= Inkjet Printer Hacking for Bio Projects =

Many papers over the years involve using either EPSON inkjet printers (piezoelectric print head) or HP/etc inkjet printers (thermal print head) to dispense very small amounts of biomaterial or biochemicals.

== EPSON Printers ==

Epson is the only brand which uses piezoelectric print heads.  Epson printers also have CD-printing, which provides a mechanical method to feed larger objects into the printer.

* Epson R280
** Open Access research paper:  "This paper presents a low-cost inkjet dosing system capable of continuous, two-dimensional spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression via delivery of diffusible regulators to a custom-mounted gel culture of E. coli. A consumer-grade, inkjet printer was adapted for chemical printing; E. coli cultures were grown on 750 µm thick agar embedded in micro-wells machined into commercial compact discs. Spatio-temporal regulation of the lac operon was demonstrated via the printing of patterns of lactose and glucose directly into the cultures; X-Gal blue patterns were used for visual feedback. We demonstrate how the bistable nature of the lac operon's feedback, when perturbed by patterning lactose (inducer) and glucose (inhibitor), can lead to coordination of cell expression patterns across a field in ways that mimic motifs seen in developmental biology."
