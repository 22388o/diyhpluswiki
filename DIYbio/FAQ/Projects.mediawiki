= IMPORTANT FAQ = 

* '''Regardless of whatever article you've read in Wired magazine, or other publication, written by journalists who don't do proper fact checking might sensationalize, most of the questions regarding engineering "new living organisms" or "replacement organs" or what have you, is currently not possible (and won't be for decades).  Sorry to have to point out the obvious. ''' -- Jonathan Cline on the DIYbio google group

Due to continual hype by the media regarding technologies which aren't yet accessible, without proper journalistic objectivity, and subsequent FAQ'ing on the DIYbio group, the following FAQ answer is offered:

  > is it possible to use (organovo or any companies) bioprinter to print
  > living organisms that are visible to the naked eye (that doesn't mean
  > it has a brain and moves around and everything, just be alive)?
  Depends on your definition of 'naked eye'.   For example, you
  could spray pigmented/glowing bacteria as graffiti, which
  eventually grow and create a portrait.  Or using a larger
  liquid handling device you might be able to spray plant cells
  onto a substrate which then grow into moss, etc.    
  Organisms, no.  A single organ, yes: can be printed, that's
  the current limit of today's technology.
  "Ink jet printer spray" of bacteria has previously been
  discussed on this group so check the archives.

= Project Ideas =

The following are project ideas (brainstorming) which have been discussed on DIYbio google group.  Research papers or existing products similar to these ideas can be found, with the DIYbio aspect of lowering the cost, open sourcing the design, and allowing latest technology (such as USB or network, for electronics devices) to be added as enhancements.

* Comparing various inexpensive reagents to the purified commercial counterparts; for example, food-grade agar-agars to commercial agaroses.

* Using LEDs as spectrophotometer, colorimeter, etc.  Some projects already exist around the web.

* Using USB/networkable microcontrollers for thermocyclers.

* Fabricating microfluidic devices and using USB microcontrollers for microfluidics (pump/valve/syringe) control.

* Printing, patterning, synthesizing various substances or microbes with inkjet printers.  Modifying gene expression with inkjet dispensing.
** Several other fields are also very engaged in modifying inkjet printers:  for making electronics circuit boards (inkjet PCB); for making physical objects (inkjet fabrication), for printing on objects (inkjet handhelds).   Check these projects for how to modify inkjet printers for Bio projects as well.

* Making a spin coater (from DC motors or computer drives) - which can be used for building microfluidics, etc

* Making Taq - See http://openwetware.org/wiki/DIYbio/FAQ/Methods#Homebrew_Taq

* Imaging system for Electrophoresis Agarose Gels (or Gel Box that includes the imaging system built-in)

* Modifying one's own biology through diet, and quantifying medical change by common and/or special medical tests, as compared to prior results and standardized results.

* Distributed testing foods sold in grocery stores or restaurants by genetic sequencing or low-cost field tests, and publishing results based on geographic region.

* Distributed Sample collection and sequencing system + protocols, with long-term archival and open source database.

== Computing Technology (Microcontrollers, etc) == 

  The following product is from Microchip.  Microchip has grown in
  interesting ways: they now have a cross-platform software development
  environment (Win, Mac, Linux) based on NetBeans (called MPLAB X).  The
  original MPLAB is one of the best microcontroller dev environments,
  especially for the cost (free), though previously limited to Windows.
  They are moving to the GNU compiler for their 32 bit
  microcontrollers.  They have an iPhone dev kit (which requires an
  Apple hardware license, since Apple is closed hardware, which some
  here don't like) and now recently announced an Android dev kit: with
  "Arduino footprint compatible for prototyping", even.  I don't want to
  stir up a big hooplah between microcontroller choice, but I will say
  that Arduino using AVR is a more expensive choice any time I've looked
  at it.  A typical microcontroller + board + periphery should not cost
  more than $60 for wired internet-capable designs and within $10-30 for
  standalone designs.
  This kit below (quite new, so docs still forthcoming) might satisfy
  some people's needs. Who here is designing smartphone-biotech-related
  devices?  Why have a lab device if it can't connect to a smart phone,
  that's my thought.  The smart phone app is the new user interface;
  don't waste $ or time building user interface LCD/touch screen/buttons
  into a lab equipment box (unless there are clean-room restrictions).

= Human Biology Projects =

"The Experimental Man" and similar ideas are based on the recent availability and affordability of personalized medical tests which expose and quantify one's own health factors.  Some biohackers are monitoring these themselves, far beyond the scope of traditional modern medicine.  Based on quantitative measurements, these biohackers are modifying their own biology using diet, vitamins, etc.

'''These related topics, especially diet, are highly controversial and it is generally not a good idea to attempt to convince others that you're "on to something."'''

== Personal Medical Monitoring ==

  If I want to completely measure my biology, this is the list of
  everything I can think of which can be measured (non-invasively), on a
  daily basis, for uploading to a PC with a smart measurement device and
  tracking/logging. Are there others?  Listed in no particular order..
  * Body mass - with typical weight scale
  * Body temperature - probably using ear thermometer
  * Body fat - this would use calipers; not sure if there's an
  electronic method.
  * Height - though this shouldn't change normally
  * Blood pressure
  * Heart rate
  * Cholesterol test - LDL, HDL, triglycerides, uses pin prick (also
  quite pricey, and painful, for every day testing).  If pin prick is
  done for this, then should test ketone levels at the same time.
  * Walking cadence / Pedometer
  * Standing weight distribution - using smart body weight scale,
  similar to Wii Fit module, detect center of gravity from standing on
  the sensor, to detect structural imbalances
  * Hearing - with simple audio test
  * Blood glucose - more important for diabetics, of course
  * Breath analysis - chemical sensing: read ketones for diet
  monitoring.  Read nitric oxide to detect inflammation (I haven't
  checked if this test is low-cost-able, these are very expensive
  units).
  Other detectors are summarized here:
  http://www.chestnet.org/accp/pccsu/medical-applications-exhaled-breat...
  * Respiration - breathing flow, with a peak flow meter
  * Mental ability - a while back the experiment used simple math
  problems with a timed computer quiz, with the same math questions
  every time, to judge some aspect of mental ability.
  * Brain activity - SoCal DIYbio is actively doing this with EEG.  Not
  sure what kind of "daily health metric" might be possible to generate.
  * Sympathetic nervous system state - from galvanic response (as I
  posted previously, and FYI, Cornell has a great project write-up with
  software here, although the "professor's preference" of using Begin
  and End statements in C is something from outer space:
  http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/ee476/FinalProjects/s2006/hm...
  * Voice recording - Although simple to record voice, I'm not sure
  there's any information which can be extracted from this.

=== Edibles and Medicines ===

  Kitchen only -> play with yeast.  Make bread by hand.  Make
  cheese by hand.  Make beer (with a simple kit).  Make kimchi.
  Easily doable and is the basis for microbial biology.  Exotic
  stuff such as tempeh is simple as well.  Kombucha is also
  interesting.  I haven't found red yeast for purple pork, still
  looking for it.  The anti-bacterial effects of some of these
  foods is under scientific investigation and also they're very
  tasty.  Studies of chinese medicine were prominently featured
  at the last synthetic biology conference in Hong Kong.
  By the way, if you brew your own beer or Kombucha, you will
  suddenly find that you have a lot of friends.  That's more of
  a sociology experiment at that point.  :-D 
:: -- Jonathan Cline on the DIYbio google group

  Kombucha is interesting stuff, definitely an acquired taste.
  Big thing to bear in mind though is that Kombucha *needs* that
  30C growth temperature, moreso than most cultures. If you have
  pure yeast, perhaps they'll be ok at cooler temperatures and
  just grow more slowly. But Kombucha is a mix of up to 7
  species, and if the temperature is wrong some species will
  dominate more than normal, making for a bizarre and
  potentially disgusting brew.
  Interesting tidbit: I was researching Gluconacetobacter
  xylinum, the species that produces the most prodigious amounts
  of microbial cellulose in culture, and found that the highest
  quality cellulose to be isolated so far appears to have been
  from a strain of G.xylinum isolated from... Kombucha. Because,
  Kombucha has been selected for boyant, homogenous "SCOBY"
  pancakes of cellulose for generations, so we've effectively
  domesticated the strain to make the perfect cellulose. I
  imagine if you were to play with the mix of yeasts and
  G.xylinum, and feed them a bland sugar-nutrient mix to avoid
  colours, you could make some great premium paper! :)

  "Using the Jell-O fabrication technique, microfluidics may be more
  easily demonstrated in a hands-on approach to convey current research
  topics to younger students and the general public. Our experience is
  that when students learn about science at a young age, they will
  become more attracted to pursuing an engineering or science degree in
  their post-secondary education. To encourage this process, three types
  of Jell-O chips have been fabricated: a Â¿JELLOÂ¿ chip, a Y-channel
  chip, and a pH sensor chip. Using these demonstrations, elementary and
  high school students, as well as the general public can learn about
  how microfluidic chips are made; learn microfluidics concepts,
  including dimensionless scaling factors, diffusion coefficients, and
  pH sensing; make the connection to current microfluidics research; and
  become excited about scientific research.
  The fabrication method is fast, simple, and inexpensive, allowing Jell-
  O chip demonstrations to enter a wide variety of learning environments
  not accessible to current microfluidics methods. Other types of chips
  (including bubble and droplet generators, not shown) can also be
  fabricated, suggesting that this technique possesses an enormous
  educational potential. Experiments with other naturally-occurring gels
  also indicate that this method could be extended to developing regions
  of the world to provide microfluidic technology both for education and
  diagnostics. Finally, we are also currently developing fabrication
  techniques for bonded and functional multilayer Jell-O chips to
  further extend the applications of this fabrication method. We hope
  that this work will serve as a model for future educational endeavors
  in science."

  The electronics will have to be replaced or bypassed, for sure.  The
  couple times I've seen spin coaters used, the dispensing didn't seem
  critical (i.e. scoop polymer onto disc during spin up) and the
  rotation seemed to even everything out.  Does your protocol require

  Spin-Coating of Polystyrene Thin Films as an Advanced Undergraduate

  http://www.jce.divched.org/Journal/Issues/2003/Jul/abs806.html
  Abstract
  A simpler version of the well-established technique of spin-coating
  thin polymer films on glass slides is described. Starting with simple
  instrumentation and using an ordinary, commercially available cooling
  fan (a "CPU cooler"), a method of spin-coating an expanded polystyrene
  foam on glass slides is described. Making thin films of commercially
  available polystyrene on glass slides is also included for comparison.
  An interferometric technique is used to measure the film thickness
  employing a UVÂ¿vis spectrophotometer. FTIR spectroscopy is used to
  verify the identity of the polymer on the glass slide. Using the BeerÂ¿
  Lambert law of absorbance, the film thickness is also calculated from
  the FTIR spectra of films. A comparison is made between the
  interferometric and FTIR methods for thickness measurements. An
  organic dye is doped into a film and a UVÂ¿vis spectrum is used to
  identify the dye.

  Spin Coater System
  This was my attempt to build a low cost spin-coater system that does
  both horizontal and vertical spin coating.  For about $70.00 dollars
  in parts and some ingenuity, I was able to put together the system
  shown below.  Ironically, we latter purchased a commercial spin-coater
  for $5000.00, but I saw little difference in the sample prepared using
  the one I built and it.  In my opinion, the only reason to even buy
  one of those things is to get better control of the overall spinning
  process.  However, most people just need something that goes around
  fast. As you can see, it's basically just an aluminum base that holds
  two small DC motors (RadioShack).  Power is supplied by a 1-10V DC
  power supply.  CDR cases serve as the spin chamber.

  Spin coater based on brushless dc motor of hard disk drivers
  Abstract
  We have developed a novel programmable, low cost, spin coater to be
  used for applications where flat substrates are coated with an uniform
  thin layer of a desirable material. The equipment is built with dc
  brushless motor present in most of the hard disk drivers (HDDs). The
  system offers manual control, wide speed range (from 0 to 10,000 rpm),
  spin speed stability and compact size. The paper also describes the
  use of such equipment for the fabrication of thin poly(o-
  methoxyaniline) (POMA) films, which are of particular interest for
  design organic electronic devices, such as diodes, transistor, sensors
  and displays.

  Pimp My Spin Coater
  If you're going to start making your own lab equipment you might as
  well trick out the new hardware. In that spirit, my spin coater has 3
  light emitting diodes: a green one, a red one, and a blue one. I can
  vary the revolution per minute from ~500rpm to ~2500rpm by varying the
  voltage I supply to the spin coater. The sample is mounted in the
  center and is stuck to the spin coater by Velcro, this can be more
  easily seen in the next photo. As can also be seen in the photo, my
  spin coater is just a regular pc fan I bought at CompUSA this past
  Wednesday. I monitor the speed of the spin coater with a laser mounted
  above the spin-coater that shines through the fan's blades and strikes
  one of our group's alpha detectors. The nice thing about the alpha
  detector is that I don't even have to supply any power to it. There is
  enough current generated, I presume by the photoelectric effect, to
  carry a signal to an oscilloscope which I can use to monitor the fan's
  speed. A picture of the laser, which is my boss's laser pointer he
  uses for talks, is seen in the next photo at the top of our group's
  only non-radioactive chemistry hood. It took me 2 days to build my
  spin coater, Wednesday and Thursday, and one more day to make sure it
  calibrates properly, Friday. The total amount in extra costs was $20
  for the spin-coater(pc fan) all the rest of the equipment we had lying
  around.

A prototype PBR was built at SDSU in 1998 that had a reactor capacity of 1 gallon.  The prototype was inoculated with algae obtain from Argonne National Laboratory and produced an algae biomass in excess of 25g.  The success of the prototype led to the decision to scale up the prototype PBR to capacity of 500 gallons.  The 500 gallon PBR is large enough to study the feasibility of commercial production algae.  In the summer of 2000 research was initiated to evaluate the feasibility of scaling up the prototype PBR.  Research revealed that little is known quantitatively about how the different subsystems interact and affect algal biomass production in PBR.  The scaled up PBR design was then modified to allow for the testing of the effect the different subsystems have on algal biomass production independently as well as interactions of the subsystems.   Test variables may be light type (wavelength), intensity of light, mixing intensity, nutrient requirements, control strategies, etc.  http://abe.sdstate.edu/faculty/garyanderson/website/pbr_home.html

* An Algae Bioreactor from Recycled Water Bottles.  In this instructable, we describe how to build a photo-bioreactor that uses algae to convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into energy. The energy that is produced is in the form of algae biomass. The photo-bioreactor is built from plastic recycled water bottles. By designing the apparatus to be compartmentalized, we are able to do many experiments in parallel.  http://www.instructables.com/id/An_Algae_Bioreactor_from_Recycled_Water_Bottles/

* I got interested in the idea of growing Spirulina at home after I obtained a breeding pair of Bristlenose Plecoâs.  What better food source than fresh Spirulina, I thought to myself.  I wondered around Google for days, which turned into weeks, then months.  No where could I find a single source that could easily explain how to grow Spirulina at home.  If you are interested in growing Spirulina at home, I hope you find this method useful. Iâll give you a quick run down of my version of âGrowing Tubesâ, both in expensive and easy to build in a day.  I went to Home Depot....   http://gpasi.org/forums/index.php?topic=64.0

* In-Home Photosynthetic Bioreactor - 1997-98. Invented by Lee Robinson, the founder of the British biotechnological company Biotechna, the Biocoil is a "photosynthetic bioreactor that provides an environment for biological organism to grow in a controlled manner."   The frame is built and clear PVC tubing is wrapped around it to form a circular model so that it is easier for photosynthesis to occur. Sunlight or artificial light is then put in at an angle to shine on the tubing while the algae flows through. Chlorella algae was used in the Sewage Sister Biocoil to remove nutrients from the sewage flowing along with the algae. The tubing of the Biocoil consists of several sections of tubing rather than one piece wrapped all of the way around. Compressed air pumps are used to push the algae and water through the Biocoil and to prevent anoxic conditions in the water. http://web.archive.org/web/20071009122237/http://advbio.cascadeschools.org/97-98/minicoil.html
:: The Biocoil Operations Manual (The Trip From the Algae's Point of View).  The Biocoil is a tertiary sewage treatment system which utilizes light and algae to remove phosphates and nitrates from secondary effluent. The Biocoil is a round unit eight feet tall and six of those feet are surrounded by 1600 feet of clear one inch inside diameter food grade tubing. This tubing is exposed to light 24 hours a day, either by natural sunlight or artificial light. The inside of the Biocoil is composed of three tanks, the contact, holding, and settling tank. The manifold which distributes water from the tanks to the tubes is also located inside the Biocoil.  http://web.archive.org/web/20070520071350/advbio.cascadeschools.org/95-96/biomanual.html

=== Basics of Growing Algae ===

"How to get started growing algae at home."

Needed:

*a space that can be easily heated or cooled depending on the weather.
*cool white flourescent lights 35-40 watts.
*aquarium aereation pump. tubing, and airstones... tees(all this from walmart.)
*shelves depending on how many cultures you want to grow
*glass jars one quart, and one gallon for as  many cultures as you plan to grow
*aquarium sea salts (Instant ocean) I cup per gallon of distilled water.
*dial thermometers
*graduated measuring cups
*Ph. papers
*Nutrient solution
*algae cultures( often come in 50 ml tubes )
*growing instructions come with the cultures.

Setup:

*when you receive the culture add the contents of the tube to 250 ml of water (salt or fresh)
*keep lights on 24/7
*keep aereation on 24/7
*once the 250 ml turns green add another 250 ml and so on untill you have a liter of green algae
*take the green  liter and add it to a gallonglass jar,
* once you have a gallon you can seed a ten gallon aquarium or you can add the gallon to larger tanks or  to  a closed loop ecosystem
*and in  two weeks, voila! youll have algae growing.
*unenclosed ponds are unstable and prone to contamination by outside influences such as acid rain, water fowl that carry  wild algae on thier feathers , animals , temperature variations.windbourne pollutants. night time temperature variations.etc

Bob's Homemade Shaking Incubator Design

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my design for an easy-to-build and inexpensive laboratory
shaker/shaking incubator. It will undoubtedly remind many readers of
something they may have built for the Science Fair in the 5th grade, but
as far as I know, the use of record-player power and the hanging
platform are original. And, hey, you can't argue with the price.

Three figures are attached. The attachments are MIME-encoded, and should
be decodable with any MIME-compliant newsreader, including the one built
into NetScape 2.0. The figures are small, black and white drawings in
GIF format, and should be viewable from any web browser, once they are
decoded.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shaking platform is cut from a particleboard sheet the same size as
the top of the box; the rest of the sheet is used to reinforce the top
of the box. The platform is suspended from the edge of the top opening
with strings. Slipknots are used in the strings to make them easy to
adjust until the platform is more-or-less level. Then the knots are
secured in place with tape. The strings and holes are arranged so that
the strings hang as vertically (i.e., parallel to one another) as
possible. This way the platform will remain essentially level as it
swings around in a circle.

A bolt is mounted on the turntable, and passed through a hole in the
platform, so that when the turntable spins, the shaker moves in an
orbital motion. Note that it takes very little work on the part of the
record palyer motor to move the platform in a horizontal circle, even if
it carries significant weight.

The heat source (light bulb), fan, and thermostat are mounted on a
particleboard base, and wired so that the fan is always on, but the
light bulb is turned on and off by the thermostat in classic Jr. High
School Science Fair fashion. The whole heat-control unit is placed in
the incubator box, and a thermometer is used to calibrate the
thermostat. The thermostat I use keeps the box somewhere 35 and 38
degrees centigrade. I think a regular home thermostat would work better,
but the bugs don't seem to mind.

The fan blows air around fast enough that air in the whole box is very
close to the same temperature. But I put the thermostat probe behind the
fan so it would not detect radiant heat, and the light is below the
platform so it doesn't shine right on the cultures.

I covered the areas of the cardboard walls and the portion of the bottom
of the platform that come close to the light bulb with foil, to reflect
some heat so they wouldn't be quite as likely to catch fire. If you fold
several thicknesses of slightly wrinkled foil together, they make a nice
shield against radiant heating (this was the suggestion of Mike Herron,
from the lab across the hall).

The box is sealed with masking tape, except for the top opening. A lid
(not shown) is made of an additional cardboard sheet, edged with soft
foam weather stripping. This type of flat lid limits the height of
culture flasks to the distance between the shaking platform and the top
of the box; alternatively, a raised lid made of a second box would allow
more room.

This shaker has three speeds; 33, 45, and 78 rpm. The fastest setting is
still somewhat slower than typical bacterial culture conditions, but it
works OK if you leave plenty of air in your flasks. A faster motor could
be substituted for the record player, but it wouldn't be as cute.

The heating unit and the record player can both be plugged into a power
strip, so a single convenient switch can be used to turn the whole thing
on and off.

The tools required are fairly simple:

* wrench, pliers, screwdriver, etc. to remove any parts of the record
player that stick up too high.

* drill to mount the bolt on the turntable, and make holes for the
strings.

* knife to cut cardboard and strip insulation on the wires.

* jigsaw to cut the platform from the particleboard.

My estimate of the cost of materials is as follows:

* cardboard box, string, tape, etc.: $0.00

* record player: $0.75 (yes, I can get them in Minneapolis for 75 cents
at the "Digger's Delight" behind Goodwill on Como Avenue near Highway
280. Otherwise they may run you 5 bucks apiece at a garage sale).

* thermostat: $3.50 from AxMan surplus, University Ave., St. Paul. At a
hardware store, these cost about $12.

* fan: $7.50. I used a 120V AC box fan, about 4 inches in diameter
(AxMan Surplus). I couldn't find one the right size at Digger's, but
keep your eyes peeled.

* light socket: $0.85 (hardware store)

* weather stripping: ~$3

* power strip: ~$3.50 (only used for the Shaker Deluxe). 

* thermometer: $1.19

*I scrounged the light bulb and the particleboard. (Retail ~$3?)  

So I have over $20 invested in my shaking incubator, and it could easily cost over $23 if you had to buy particleboard and stuff. Old record players also make great sample rotators, if you set them at a steep angle, or they can be used to wash gels and blots, if you put your pan on the turntable and slightly raise one end of the record player. The only shaking incubator I have in my current lab is of this design (serial number 00000001). I have used it to grow 50 ml E. coli cultures in LB, in regular 500ml Erlenmeyers, and 1.5ml cultures in TB in 15 ml snap-cap tubes. I have recently used this incubator to clone a cDNA sequence for a novel human neurotransmitter receptor subunit. But I'll try not to let Real Science interfere too much with inventin' stuff. :)

Happy shakin'!

== Gene Gun ==

  You can make your own gene gun using either a modified pellet
  gun, or by turning a diaphragm valve on a lathe and pulsing a
  low-density high-pressure gas to a small aperture, or by
  shooting a prepped wall of a vacuum chamber to disperse a
  prepared nug of DNA coated fine metal particles with a small
  arm (don't do this).
  Here's a video that'll give you a good idea of how they can be
  used, they're good for transforming most things.
  Also be aware the video contains a rat brain being autopsied.
  http://www.jove.com/details.php?id=675 
  The manufacture of the ammunition is the tricky part, it
  involves engineering the DNA payload and binding it to very
  small tungsten or gold particles. The process is outlined in
  the video, note the part where the plastic tube is filled with
  dried metal-bound dna and cut up to make bullets.

= Homebrew Centrifuge =

'''Warning: Building a high speed device is dangerous.  Take appropriate measures to ensure safety.'''

== Physics ==

: Jonathan Cline: ''A basic equation of physics, for those out there building their own centrifuges: What are RPM, RCF, and g force and how do I convert between them?   The magnitude of the radial force generated in a centrifuge is expressed relative to the earthâs gravitational force (g force) and known as the RCF (relative centrifugal field).  RCF values are denoted by a numerical number in âgâ (ex. 1,000 x g).  It is dependent on the speed of the rotor in revolutions per minute (RPM) and the radius of rotation.  Most centrifuges are set to display RPM but have the option to change the readout to RCF.  To convert between the two by hand, use the following equation:  RCF  =  11.18 (rcm) (rpm/1000)^2  Where rcm = the radius of the rotor in centimeters.''  http://88proof.com/synthetic_biology/blog/archives/380

== Dremelfuge ==

Cathal Garvey has designed a simple centrifuge using open source hardware technology, and you can order one yourself!   '''Dremelfuge''' is a rotor designed to fit standard lab microcentrifuge tubes and miniprep/purification columns, to be spun by either a powerdrill or other chuck-loading machine or by a popular rotary tool. Dremelfuge features an easy click-in loading system which holds tubes parallel to the plane of rotation for optimum pelleting and delivery of force. Intended basic applications of Dremelfuge include column purification (tested to work with miniprep columns) and bacterial/cell debris pelleting (under testing). With standard microcentrifuge tubes, the average rotary distance is 4cms. Results are shown with the Dremelfuge used to pellet E. Coli samples.  Dremelfuge is open-source hardware.

I've just published my first designs on Shapeways, for a $100 Gel Boat
and Comb set.
Sit these into a plastic container with some graphite electrodes at
either end, and you have a complete gel electrophoresis kit.
I intend to make more designs and share them both on this shop and
with the open-source community in the near future!

http://www.shapeways.com/shops/labsfromfabs

The designs are open source, and are available on Thingiverse.com for
those with access to a 3D printer.. just be sure and let me know the
results please! I'm awaiting my own 3D printer right now so I'm
itching to see results.

Note: Because of the opaque nature of the printed plastic, UV

= Inkjet Printer Hacking for Bio Projects =

Many papers over the years involve using either EPSON inkjet printers (piezoelectric print head) or HP/etc inkjet printers (thermal print head) to dispense very small amounts of biomaterial or biochemicals.

== EPSON Printers ==

Epson is the only brand which uses piezoelectric print heads.  Epson printers also have CD-printing, which provides a mechanical method to feed larger objects into the printer.

* Epson R280
** Open Access research paper:  "This paper presents a low-cost inkjet dosing system capable of continuous, two-dimensional spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression via delivery of diffusible regulators to a custom-mounted gel culture of E. coli. A consumer-grade, inkjet printer was adapted for chemical printing; E. coli cultures were grown on 750 Âµm thick agar embedded in micro-wells machined into commercial compact discs. Spatio-temporal regulation of the lac operon was demonstrated via the printing of patterns of lactose and glucose directly into the cultures; X-Gal blue patterns were used for visual feedback. We demonstrate how the bistable nature of the lac operon's feedback, when perturbed by patterning lactose (inducer) and glucose (inhibitor), can lead to coordination of cell expression patterns across a field in ways that mimic motifs seen in developmental biology."
