Various DNA editing and genome editing techniques

* restriction nucleases
* endonucleases, exonucleases
* zinc finger nucleases
* proof-reading mechanisms
* polymerase
* terminal deoxytidyl transferase (TdT)
* recombinase, strand invasion, etc.
* zinc-finger recombinase
* site-specific recombinase
* CRISPR/CAS9
* TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases), TALE proteins, 
* non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
* homologous recombination
* flippase
* DNA ligase IV, ligases, ligation, stuff...
* phage integrase (such as Î» phage integrase (Int))
* retroviral integrase

* DNA repair pathways, error-prone DNA repair pathways
* bacterial immune systems
* chimeric recombinases, various other protein chimeras should be investigated, various fusion protein stuff too..
* homology-directed repair (HDR) of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs)
* homing endonucleases
* programmable endonucleases (zinc finger nucleases, TALE nucleases, cas9, fCas9)
