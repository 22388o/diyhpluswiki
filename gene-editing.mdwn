Various DNA editing and genome editing techniques

* restriction nucleases
* endonucleases, exonucleases
* zinc finger nucleases
* proof-reading mechanisms
* polymerase
* terminal deoxytidyl transferase (TdT)
* recombinase, strand invasion, etc.
* zinc-finger recombinase
* site-specific recombinase
* CRISPR/CAS9
* TALENs
* non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
* homologous recombination
* flippase


* DNA repair pathways
* bacterial immune systems
* chimeric recombinases, various other protein chimeras should be investigated
