* temperature stability - need to work rapidly at lowered temperature
* pH stability - selection of buffers for extraction and purification; selection of conditions for ion exchange, affinity or reversed phase chromatography
* organic solvents stability - selection of conditions for reverse phase chromatography
* detergent requirement - consider effects on chromatographic steps and the need for detergent removal. consider choice of detergent.
* salt (ionic strength) - selection of conditions for precipitation techniques and hydrophobic interaction chromatography
* cofactors for stability and activity - selelection of additives, pH, salts, buffers
* protease sensitivity - need for fast removal of proteases or addition of inhibitors
* sensitivity to metal ions - need to add EDTA or EGTA in buffers
* redox sensitivity - need to add reducing agents
* molecular weight - selection of gel filtration media
* charge properties - selection of ion exchange conditions
* biospecific affinity - selection of ligand for affinity medium
* post translational modifications - selection of group specific affinity medium
* hydrophobicity - selection of medium for hydrophobic interaction chromatography




protein properties used during purification

* charge - ion exchange (IEX)
* size - gel filtration (GF)
* hydrophobicity - hydrophobic interaction (HIC), reversed phase (RPC)
* biorecognition (ligand specifity) - affinity (AC)
* charge, ligand specificity or hydrophobicity - expanded bed adsorption (EBA) follows the principles of AC, IEX or HIC

    intermediate: 1stars
    polish: 3stars

"Ammonium sulphate precipitation is a common sample clarification and concentration step at laboratory scale and in this situation HlC (which requires high salt to enhance binding to the media) is ideal as the capture step. The salt concentration and the total sample volume will be significantly reduced after elution from the HlC column. Dilution of the fractionated sample or rapid buffer exchange using a Sephadex G-25 desalting column will prepare it for the next IEX or AC step."

"GF is well suited for use after any of the concentrating techniques (IEX, HlC, AC, EBA) since the target protein will be eluted in a reduced volume and the components from the elution buffer will not affect the gel filtration separation (gel filtration is a non-binding technique with limited volume capacity and unaffected by buffer conditions)."



Logical combinations of chromatographic steps

crude sample -> GF (desalt mode) -> AC -> ___ -> GF
crude sample -> GF (desalt mode) -> IEX -> ___ -> GF
crude sample -> Hlc (dilution may be needed) -> IEX -> GF
crude sample -> GF (desalt mode) -> IEX -> HlC -> GF

clear or very dilute samples -> AC -> GF or RPC
clear or very dilute samples -> IEX -> GF or RPC
clear or very dilute samples -> IEX -> HlC -> GF
clear or very dilute samples -> precipitation (e.g., in high ionic strength) -> resolubilise -> treat as for sample in high salt concentration

"A sample is purified using a combination of techniques and alternative selectivities. For example, in an IEX-HlC-GF Three Phase Strategy the capture step selects according to differences in charge (IEX), the intermediate purification step according to differences in hydrophobicity (HlC) and the final polishing step according to differences in size (GF)."

IEX-HlC-GF is regarded as the standard if you know nothing about the proteins.

PMSF is a hazardous chemical. Half-life time in aqueous solution is 35 min. PMSF is usually stored
as 10 mM or 100 mM stock solution (1.74 or 17.4 mg/ml in isopropanol) at - 20Â° C.
* Protease inhibitors are available in pre-made mixes from several suppliers.
