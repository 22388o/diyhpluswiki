# Oligonucleotide synthesis using the phosphoramidite method

## Synthesis cycle steps

The following steps are for the addition of each nucleotide to the growing oligos. It's not the complete set of steps. Each addition of a nucleotide requires the following steps.

### 1. Deblocking (detritylation)

Detritylation occurs using an acid such as 2% [trichloroacetic acid (TCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichloroacetic_acid) or 3% [dichloroacetic acid (DCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroacetic_acid), in an inert solvent ([dichloromethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloromethane) or [toluene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene)).

- produces an orange-colored DMT cation which needs to be washed out
- oligonucleotide precursor has a free 5'-terminal hydroxyl group
- using a stronger acid or conducting detritylation for an extended time, leads to [depurination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depurination) of the oligonucleotide

### 2. Coupling

A 0.02–0.2 M solution of nucleoside phosphoramidite (or a mixture of several phosphoramidites) in acetonitrile is activated by a 0.2–0.7 M solution of an acidic azole catalyst (below). The mixing is usually very brief and occurs in fluid lines of oligonucleotide synthesizers (see below) while the components are being delivered to the reactors containing solid support. The extension reaction forms a phosphite triester linkage (below).

The concentration of the activator is primarily determined by its solubility in acetonitrile and is irrespective of the scale of the synthesis.

Upon the completion of the coupling, any unbound reagents and by-products are removed by washing.

acidic azole catalysts:

- 1H-tetrazole
- 2-ethylthiotetrazole
- 2-benzylthiotetrazole
- 4,5-benzylthiotetrazole
- 4,5-dicyanoimidazole
- alternatives can be found here: Wei, Xia (2013). "Coupling activators for the oligonucleotide synthesis via phosphoramidite approach". Tetrahedron 69 (18): 3615–3637. doi:[10.1016/j.tet.2013.03.001](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.tet.2013.03.001).

phosphite triester linkage: The activated phosphoramidite in 1.5 – 20-fold excess over the support-bound material is then brought in contact with the starting solid support (first coupling) or a support-bound oligonucleotide precursor (following couplings) whose 5'-hydroxy group reacts with the activated phosphoramidite moiety of the incoming nucleoside phosphoramidite to form a phosphite triester linkage.

Highly sensitive to water. Commonly carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile.

### 3. Capping

- mixture of acetic anhydride and [1-methylimidazole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-methylimidazole) (or less often, [DMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Dimethylaminopyridine)) as catalysts
- unreacted 5'-hydroxy groups are acetylated by the capping mixture
- capping reagent solution helps prevent reactions that might cleave the oligonucleotide (because of depurination, the apurinic sites are readily cleaved under the basic conditions of later steps). Capping reagent solution helps as long as the capping step is performed prior to oxidation with I<sub>2</sub>/water.

### 4. Oxidation

The newly formed tricoordinated phosphite triester linkage is not natural and is of limited stability under the conditions of oligonucleotide synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water in the presence of a weak base (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the phosphite triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate diester internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (see Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the latter case, the sulfurization step is best carried out prior to capping.

## ABI 391 reagents

bottles:

1. adenosine phosphoramidite (A) (deoxyadenosine (dA-bz) phosphoramidite) (beta-cyanoethyl, as all the other phosphoramidites)
2. guanosine phosphoramidite (G) (deoxyguanosine (dG-ib) phosphoramidite)
3. cytosine phosphoramidite (C) (deoxycytosine (dC-bz) phosphoramidite)
4. thymidine phosphoramidite (T) (deoxythymidine (dT) phosphoramidite)
5. spare phosphoramidite reservoir for modified bases (X), such as deoxyinosine
9. tetrazole/acetonitrile (180 mL)
11. acetic anhydride/iutidine/THF (180 mL)
12. 1-methylimidazole (180 mL)
14. trichloroacetic acid (450 mL)
15. iodine/water/pyridine/THF (200 mL)
18. acetonitrile (4 L)

also the following two might either be separate bottles or the same as bottle 18 (dunno):

* anhydrous acetonitrile, for dissolving phosphoramidites
* ammonium hydroxide

also:

* argon
* concentrated ammonia
* concentrated ammonium hydroxide
* waste bottle (because "The synthesizer generates 1 to 2 liters of hazardous, halogenated, organic liquid waste per 100 base additions. The waste is collected in a 4 liter polyethylene bottle which is placed on the floor or on a nearby bench lower than the instrument. The bottle can be kept inside a protective carrier to contain accidental spillage. A 1 gallon carrier is sufficient and can be purchased. When the bottle is emptied, it must be emptied using a specific procedure.)

There are three types of protecting groups:

1. 5' protecting group - dimethoxytrityl (DMT)
2. beta-cyanoethyl phosphate protecting groups
3. base protecting groups - benzoyl on dA and dC and isobutyryl on dG

The 5'-protecting group, dimethoxytrityl, is attached to each nucleoside phosphoramidite and is cleaved from the growing oligonucleotide chain during each cycle of base addition. You can program the 391 to remove the last DMT to yield a 5' hydroxyl by choosing the ending method Trityl off, or leave the DMT on by choosing the ending method Trityl on. When purifying by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or ion exchange HPLC2, the last DMT group should be removed. When purifying by trityl-specific OPC or reverse phase HPLC, the last DMT group should be left on.

To remove oligonucleotides from the solid supports, use concentrated ammonium hydroxide for simultaneous decyanoethylation and cleaving. Next, the base protecting groups are removed by the addition of fresh concentrated ammonia and incubation at 55 degrees celsius.
