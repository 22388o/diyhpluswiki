Here are some things that have been done with custom DNA.

* Salmonella typhimurium spider silk protein secretion
* production of insulin
* production of human growth hormone
* clotting factors to treat haemophilia
* biofuel stuff
* blue rose (Florigene, Suntory)
* plant (crop) tolerance to herbicides like glufosinate and glyphosate
* plant (crop) tolerance or resistance to ringspot virus
* plant (crop) production of bt toxin (an insecticide)
* cassava with lower cyanogen glucosides and enhanced with protein and other nutrients
* golden rice (to help fix Vitamin A deficiency)
* vitamin-enriched variant of South African white corn
* Camelina sativa oils
* green fluorescent protein (GFP) modification of mice
* ATryn, an anticoagulant that reduces blood clotting during surgery
* * "On 6 February 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first human biological drug produced from such an animal, a goat. The drug, ATryn, is an anticoagulant which reduces the probability of blood clots during surgery or childbirth. It is extracted from the goat's milk."
* enviropig, a pig engineered to digest plant phosphorous
* dairy cows to produce human breast milk (China, Argentina)
* allergy-free dairy cow milk (New Zealand)
* pig production of omega-3 fatty acids based on a roundworm gene
* growth hormone for fish, see AquaBounty
* malaria-resistant mosquitoes
* GloFish (fluorescent zebra fish)
* plant/crop with a gene from the winter flounder
* Flavr Savr tomato, longer shelf life
* ice-minus strain of P. syringae to protect crops from frost
* virus-resistant tobacco in China (1992)
* bromoxynil (a herbicide) resistant tobacco
* insect resistant cotton (MON1445)
* insect resistant maize (MON810)
* herbicide tolerant soybean
* miraculin (taste-modifying protein) in transgenic lettuce
* mammalian expression of an infrared fluorescent protein
* novel color vision in mice via transgenic expression of a photopigment protein
* enlarged forebrains in mice via transgenic overexpression of beta-catenin
* fluorescent sensors of cell membrane potential
* MagA protein as a method of producing magnetic nanoparticles

# in processed food production

* alpha-amylase from bacteria, which converts starch to simple sugars
* chymosin from bacteria or fungi, which clots milk protein for cheese making
* pectinesterase from fungi, which improves fruit juice clarity
