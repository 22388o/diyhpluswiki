transhumanism is the recursive process of technological self-improvement

  reference extropian principles http://www.maxmore.com/extprn3.htm

  with the right sort of cultivation, a human's capabilities can grow in any given
  dimension. although there exist many capabilities one may wish to improve, here
  we will only include those capabilities which are expected to contribute to
  further improvement. thus "the ability to fool oneself with wishful thinking" is
  not included in the list of justifications.

  sort projects by dimension of capability, feasibility, and expected effectiveness

  effectiveness is defined as the relative contribution of a given technology on a
  scale of 0 to infinity, where if the sum of all technologies a group has access
  to is greater than 1, then the group is able to create new technologies.
  technologies that affect the brain and that directly create new technologies are
  of special consideration because of the possibility of a positive feedback cycle
  of growth.


list of justifications, our core goals and values:
- overcoming limits (increase maximum performance)
  - physical strength
  - perseverance
    - sustained attention
  - maximum complexity awareness
  - bandwidth in
    - sensory awareness
    - information awareness
    - pattern recognition complexity per unit time (increase)
  - bandwidth out
    - action latency
    - expressiveness
    - reduced time to mutual understanding
      - communicate mental state and perceived history
      - communicate plans, goals, models

- improve system resilience (increase minimum performance) (zero performance means you're dead)
  - mobility
  - eliminate single points of failure
    - biological immortality
    - increase diversity
    - partition society into loosely coupled units
      - self-sufficiency

- improve effectiveness (increase average performance)
  - signal to noise ratio (increase)
    - reduce extraneous input
    - increase network size
  - social interaction cross section (increase)
    - flattening of social hierarchies
    - reduce duplicated effort
      - repeatable open source development
    - delegation (offloading)
      - leverage diversity of talent
  - memory
  - spatial awareness
  - technology that enables technology development
    - more useful mental models
      - more predictive human performance descriptors
  - reduction of unnecessary pain
  - create drive for improvement
