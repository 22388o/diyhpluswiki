H+ Summit 2010 @ Harvard: Rise of the Citizen-Scientist
June 12-13, Harvard University
transcript by Bryan Bishop (back of the room.. typing furiously)

I would like everyone to take a seat as quickly as possible so that we can get started. Maybe the speakers who are speaking first could sit in the front row.

Welcome to Harvard University and to H+ Summit. My name is David Orban. I am chairman of Humanity Plus. I will introduce the conference very quickly so that we can move on to fun stuff and speakers and so on. So, I want to talk about logistics for a little bit. Our conference is extremely packed with interesting information as we raelize it. We will ask that everyone have fun, but be alert to timing. We ask speakers and will be time to be aggressive in keeping you on time. At the least, to realize, at least, for example, if you have, lunch don't get back in time, the conference might start without you. And you'll miss the robot demo. So be sure to be back. Q&A. So, we have a moderated Q&A which will mean that I will ask the questions to the speakers, and Lightman will ask the questions to the speakers. All of you are welcome to send questions by twitter using the #hplus hashtag, both for tweeting and asking questions. Of course, questions are those tweets that end with a question mark. The reason why I decided to do this is because we have a global audience, not only to our individual people on the stream, also in the cities in Moscow, Petersburgh, Melbourne, listening groups that have been organized. Taking advantage of the timezone difference. I want to give them the same opportunity that you have, to answer questions too. We will have a series of nice announcements. I think they are nice. These will come up at unexpected moments, taking you off guard. Another reason to be here all the time. I want to thank of course, all of the people who have helped making this happen. Alex Lightman, our conference coordinator ???, The Harvard Future Society who is hosting and organizing, Christian Anderson, Sarah, Jant Lee, who have helped with promotion and using every possible channel. And of course, I want to thank all of our speakers, and all of you at the least. This conference is for you. Make sure you go ahead and tweet and blog. We have an official blogging site at scientificblogging. You can sign up for a blogging account and start telling your story about the conference as it happens, in real time. The wifi should be available to everybody. Don't worry, we won't do a Steve Jobs, because there are three wired connections. So go wild. That's it for me, the next speaker is Alex Lightman.
