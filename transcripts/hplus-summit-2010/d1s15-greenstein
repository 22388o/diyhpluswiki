We could measure the way we're beginning to resonance, in a common field. I wanted to let you know that I am one of the non-profit institues here today, and after my talk, if you're interested in me, your contributions and volunteer services. I would like to start by asking everyone to form a self-inquiry, experiment in this room, by noticing your own ___ right now. The movement of the actual breath. The way of addressing a somatic interface. Notice your breath, how it feels to breath- inhalation and exhalation. Now please close your eyes, and do it again.

So we're going to close our eyes together, and notice the physical sensation of breathing, and when you notice the sensation of breathing, I ask you to pay close attention to breathing, the kind of pathotation of movement, maybe movement in your shoulders, movement in your ribs, or in your stomach and back. And then with that sense of breathing, see if you can shift your attention, to picturing a sticky substance, keeping your eyes closed, seei f you can hold that picutre of stickiness in your mind's eye, there's surgical tape, or is it kind of fluid-like liquid glue. Does it feel kind of tacky, as if you can feel right through it, or gummy like the back of the post-its? See if you can savor the sense, the haptic sense, the visual sense, whatever kind of imaginative sensation you're getting, see if you can hold on to that. And then when you're ready you can open your eyes. Let's get sticky together.

I wanted to know what we got in stickiness. How many people here got velcro? Did I get any velcro? Did I get anybody with static cling? How about the gecko? Climbing up the wall with its pads. I am in the room of molecular biologists, so you went right to the loopy molecules. What we have in common here is a metaphor that I want to put before you, I am one of the people here that addresses the perceptual metathinking of bringing art and science together, to think about stickies. What we know about the central nervous system is specifically that stickiness is what happens when neurons fire together, wire together. 

Wire together, fire together. Put this into your thinking. When you're developing these technologies, and molecular sciences, but I think when we begin to deal with stickiness, when I deal with it, when you grow to a S.I.T practice- somatic intelligence tracking system. Here's who here from MIT? So you know the semantic interface at TED at 2009. That was the somatic interface outside the body, outside the body world. I am most interested in the world and beginning to look at the world of S.I.T practices that deal with introception, and our own brain's ability to fire and wire.

I want to bring your attention to an argument that took place in 209, neuroleadership summit. We had someone from Australia making the claim that if we can measure it, we can manage it. Then we had Geoffrey Shortts, retorted, if we can manage it, we can measure it. Sparing between two men who made brilliant careers addressing the ways in whcih we can measure and manage our own brain-minds, and integrating them into our body, and make them electric and shine.

Schwartz Formula for developing with OCD sufferers, boils down to a four-step procedure to relabel, reattribute attention, refocus attention, revalue attention. In other words, when I ask you to first pay attention to breathing, and then shift your attention to an image, we had that potential to couple the stickiness of our attention to something other than the wandering mind. Evan Gordon, developing banks of neuroscience research, the largest ever; the Brain Resource Company, which is online. He's most interested in measurement using some form of EEG or fMRI and I want to mention that build your own EEG classes at Machine Project. We have people building their own arduino biofeedback machine. This is the sort of tech that I am pointing to, and beyond that.

Measuring. Here we're talking about questions, growing social bonding, desire, or how we can address how we make decisions, or feel fear, or for those of you who are watching the discussion between (?????). Maybe you're looking into measuring your divergent thought processes in the hypothalamus. There's a group measuring, and I thought I'd bring it up, Bill C. Scott, Brain Paint, or brainpaint.com, and they are one of the examples for how we can measure and manage. How many people know brainpaint?

What we're really talking about are, is is is, not a dualistic argument, but an argument that says look, if we're interested in this medical path, which my colleagues are pointing towards, biotechnologically and so on, but not just as the measurement, but the representation of the measurement. Who are my artists in the room? Excellent. We're really talking about the civilian scientist artist, we're talking about the ability to figure out a representation systme with these technologies. So we've got the fractal as a brand, that comes up as a brand. That's what the brainpaint.com system does- addiction, using neurofeedback to address the suffering, we've got EmWave, out of HearthMath, Dr. Childre. We've got the sine wave in the brand, where you can see the measures of your heart. You also have My Calm Beat, brainresource.com

I say that what we're really talking about is fractals and sine waves, is sticky attention? Marketing with that, as well as developing new science around that brand. Since I don't have much time, here's a chart of these three companies, dealing with mobile graphics, pretty much with frontal cortex and ANS as well as the somasensory area which is really key in somatotrophy, and we're talking about a Life Reboot, where we're taking the most primary survival system - breathing is the most important survival skill- and the scientists and artists in the room- representations, we're talking about augmenting the coherenceo f signals, which actually changes the entire netwroking in relation to the whole body and brain. Talking specifically about quantification systems, and I'd like to see you push those, and specifically the representation of the quantification, so that we have an image with a number, a wave, a fractal, or whatever. I'm really asking you to begin to assist on the unification and connectivity between art and science, and for those of you who know about Brain Awareness Week. This is a good chance to bring this into Hospitals and Schools. Thank you very much.
