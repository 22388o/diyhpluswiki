New technologies to enrich your mind. Expanding consciousness with brain-machine interfaces. My talk about is improving brain function, and the brain, as if is functions. So, what is the best way, conscousness. Conscoiusness is our unique ability to experience brain processes. Different processes give different rises to qualia. When .. this.. smell.. taste.. pain. And uh, all this experience forms consciousness. Richer using new technologies. I think that this is possible, to make a brain, even to rise to some new consciousness in your mind, like neurons in your brain. But, uh, synthetic qualia.

Somehow to synthesize consciousness.
