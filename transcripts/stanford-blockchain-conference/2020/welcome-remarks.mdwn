wifi: Stanford, blockchain/blockchain

Okay, we're going to get started in five minutes. We're going to get started. We have a fully packed day. Everybody can grab their seats and then we can get started.

Alright. So let's do this.

Okay, welcome to the fourth Stanford Blockchain Conference. It's been a lot of fun running this conference for a couple of years now. There's a few quick administrative things I wanted to say. If you want to get on the wifi network, then just go to the Stanford wifi network. There's Stanford and Stanford Visitor. You can go to the Stanford one and click on "sponsored account" and then use the very secure username/password blockchain/blockchain and that will get you on to the Stanford network. Either one will work, though.

The entire event for the three days is going to be livestreamed. The links are on the program website so you can see them there too. If you want to watch the livestream, you can see that in the other rooms. If you want to tweet about the conference or things being said, there's a hashtag for that. There's also a parking lot and a parking code: 6162 and parking is on us. So just remember that for the following days.

This conference is about bringing together two communities: the practiocioners who run vafious blockchain projects, and academic researchers trying to answer questions. We've tried to make this a technical conference. This is specifically about technology. We want to discuss new ideas, research challenges, and obviously researchers like me get interested in new questions. Maybe the speakers have some open questions they would like the community to think about. The goal is to bring together the practicioners and the academics in this space.

This conference got a lot of registrations. We have 1400 people registered which is remarkable. If they all come here and all in person, we're going to have some interesting problems. But I can tell you that actually given the number of registrants, we tried to get the Stanford football stadium for the conference but unfortunately they wouldn't let us so we settled for this beautiful facility. Since it will be so crowded, we are asking people to squeeze in. We're going to have to share the space.

The other thing is, there's overflow space at the other end of the building. The whole building is ours for the whole three days. We have streaming on the other end, there will be TV screens so you can watch everything. It's much more comfortbale to sit over there because there's tables and power. You can go to the other side of the building and it's pretty close.

The other thing is that if you want to talk, try not to talk at the far end of the room and take the conversation outside instead and it will help the speakers and audience.

The program itself is organized by myself, Benedikt Bunz, and Byron Gibson. A round of applause to Benedikt and Byron.
