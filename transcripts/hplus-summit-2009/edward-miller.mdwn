Alright, so, technology, the fundamental characteristic of it is that it allows us to manipulate our environment and the material world. Us humans are a part of the material world. We have a way to reach into the atmosphere and down into the depths of subjectivity. The catch is that, now anyone can design a system. We really need to be concerned with what we're building. The founder of cybernetics on Norbert Weiner. The world of the future will be even more demanding of our intelligence, not just a cultural hammock to be waited around by our robot slaves.

We need to know what systems are. Systems have inputs and outputs. That's the most basic definition. It's not really inspiring. Within its context, it can be pretty inspiring. There are other contexts. The economy. The internet. Brains are pretty much all systems, they are decentralized nodes of inputs and outputs. Even the U.S. government, in fact appearances to the contrary, is infact a system. Our subjectivity is that we are subject to layers upon layers of systems. We interact with these systems. We change them and they change us, and the systems interact with each other too. And basically, a lot of psychologists, like Eric F.. have talked about place your self-worth as something internal instead of something external. It's basically impossible to do something .. interpersonal relationships, and so forth. These systems constantly reproduce your information. Your brain is a system too. It has inputs and outputs. Basically you are co-creating this world that you are living in. Maybe you want to separate yourself out from that, but it's not really possible. What we realize though is that the way we think about the world effects the way we can achieve our goals. Perhaps you believe the world is flat? You're not going to get very far.
