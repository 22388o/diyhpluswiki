The new low bar

Gabriel Licina

# Introduction

I bought presents, by the way. Just like last year. My name is Gabriel. I work for a 501c3 non-profit called Scihouse. I actually made notes. This is a big deal for me. It's going to be different from most of my talks, which is why I'm sitting instead of ranting. What I'm talking about is important, so I've put some effort into it.

I am not really a biohacker anymore. I'm pretty burnt out on that term. If you have a Thermo Fischer account, you're not really hacking biology. If you're buying your materials second hand from someone, then you're not really a biohacker either. Buying from Jimmy Johns doesn't make you a sandwhich hacker. No, you just fucking ordered a sandwhich, so be okay with that.

As much as we would like to pretend we live in a Doctor Sleepless comic, we have to kind of face the facts. That's what this talk is going to be about. I am going to be used certain language.

I am going to talk about how some friends did something really amazing and how we want to share it with you and how we want your participation to move forward on that. The next thing is about outlining some of the flaws we've run into. What would Gabriel be without being hypercritical about things? The third thing is the next big project for me, and I hope for you as well, and how you guys can help. I honestly believe all of you are capable of giving me free labor for this.

# Glybera

Gene therapy got approved in the European Union. It deals with lipase deficiency.  Glybera. If you're part of this small population, an extremely small popualtion that has this thing, your body is incapable of breaking down triglycerides in a responsible fashion. One of the symptoms of having this disease is that your blood is white because it's so filled with fat. Is that my timer already? Your blood has become white. It's actually really, really bad. It causes a lot of suffering. It's the first gene therapy that was approved in the European Union back in 2015. They put it on the market for $1 million dollars. One person got it, after they put it on the market. They had 38 people that got it as--- they were test subjects. It has been tested in mice, dogs, cats, monkeys, and it's been tested in human beings. It works. But it's $1 million dollars.

It's a million dollars because the pharma companies that-- they didn't build the drug. We think the pharma companies make drugs, but they don't. The pharma companies that were selling the drug decided that this was the price for a therapy that made it so that these people don't suffer anymore. So it got pulled from the market because $1 million-- nobody can pay a million dollars. There was one insurance company in Germany that covered it, for one human being. It was really rough on the academics that created it, because they had no idea this was going to happen. They thought they were going to make something that would actually help a lot of people. Clinical trials happened, and then the super price.

Andreas Strumer one day-- wave, say hi. He's brilliant. He messaged me one day and said let's reverse engineering Glybera. We got a hold of a friend, David Ishee. He is also a brilliant man. He deserves as much time as I do, I'm just louder. So we said, let's do this thing. We used a backbone that was developed by David Ishee. Andreas put together the gene sequence that he then responsibly had printed out by a third party company because building things from scratch in your home lab is stupid and tedious and dumb. I have a mammalian cell lab, so I tested it. Oh my god, it actually works. For the cost of I think all included everything that it took, it cost $7,000 to do this. This was a one time cost. It won't be $7,000 every time. Doing this again is only going to take a handful of pennies. In fact, I brought some to share with everyone.

What you can see here, if you're interested in the data-- and I also have raw data from the machine. Message me, I will send you the excel file and you could get all the information because this is important. This is our standardized curve. We want a professional kit to test this. This is an LPL deficiency kit. Researchers and doctors use this all the time. Here's our standardized curve of the data we should be expecting, and this is what we're calling the DMEM peak, because we're doing mammalian cells. Here's our expression of LPL. Pretty dope, right? It worked. It cost $7,000 and we did it in 2 months.

# The new low bar

That's it. This is the new low bar. We have set the low bar for the most basic bullshit biohackers get together and make something that doesn't look like garbage, which might actually work and help people. Good job, team. Yay.

This was developed in a shed in Mississipi. A warehouse in Florida. A bedroom in Indiana and on a computer in Austria because he's in Austria and he does the computer things, and I handle physical things, and neither of us technically break the law. So this is the new low bar.

Focus on things that are important instead of drama and hype, media people.

Step zero is to not inject yourself with this thing. For the love of god, please stop stabbing yourselves. The first step is to get the material tested by others. Which is why I brought it, to get it tested by others. This is the plasmid in ecoli. You can turn it into minicircles or whatever you want. If there's anyone here from a professional university, I have purified plasmids right here. I am sure there's a bored grad student out there, who can prove me wrong, or prove me right. This is called peer review, have you guys heard of that?

I have brought these materials to share with you people so that you can do this as well. I know this is against the biohacker ethic because the primary theme of the biohacker ethic lately has been "eh, I'm going to do something cool that someone else has already done and something something entrepreneurialism". I would like the community to move beyond htat. I would like people to start doing responsible work. We have no splash page for this, we have no investors, it's Creative Commons licensed. Nobody can make any money off of this, but you might do something good for the world.
