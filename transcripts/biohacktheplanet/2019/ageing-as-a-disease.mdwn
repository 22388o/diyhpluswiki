Ageing as a disease

Aubrey de Grey, KristenVBrown

# Introduction

KB: Thanks so much for being here. I'm sure people will have a lot of questions to Aubrey. Thank you to you and your beard for being here. First, let's define things. When people talk about life extension, they mean a lot of different things. What do you mean when you talk about life extension?

AG: I want to applaud you for starting with that. There's so much bullshit spoken in this space about the whole thing that we do. It all comes down to a failure of definition. For me, first of all, we have to define what we mean by the word ageing. An enormous amount of the failures that we have seen really throughout our whole history surely our past century with regard to the attempt to bring ageing under medical control, has arisen from a failure to understand what we mean by the word ageing. People think there's some kind of distinction or fundamental biological difference between the things that we think of as the diseases of ageing, like Alzheimer's or most cancers or arthritis, versus this thing called ageing itself. What the hell is this thing called ageing itself? Nobody can actually tell you. They come up with things like... fraility. People have come up with precise definitions, but not just one definition, it's like-- it's crazy. The reason why it's crazy is because there's no actual definition. The thing that we call the diseases of old age are not diseases of old age at all. They are not diseases at all. They are simply aspects of aging that we have chosen to give disease-like names to. Once we understand that, that the word "disease" should be narrowed in use, to apply only to the health problems that people have earlier in life, then things get much more clear.

KB: HOw would you define success in this realm?

AG: Success in combating ageing by medical means in this area is defined as keeping people healthy irrespective of how long ago they were born. By healthy, obviously I do not mean healthy for your age, because that would be circular. I mean healthy in terms of physical function-- as healthy, as functional as someone who was born only 20 or 30 years ago.

KB: Just to clarify, in this versi onof this success, then we could potentially live indefinitely?

AG: Right. Certainly what we know, obviously, is that today most people what they die of is being sick. Not being healthy, right. Not usually an asteroid impact, although we're working on that too. The main purpose of working on self-driving autonomous vehicles is so that people don't die on the road, besides the efficiency gains. This is going to be as much as an emphasis as it becomes the main reason why we die, rathe rthan the current main reason which is having been born a long time ago. We will only have the same causes of death at 120 years old as we presently do at 20 years old.

KB: I worry about dying of a shark attack.

AG: I have a fine method of preventing that, which is not going into the water. The fact is, people worry about this. About 12 years ago, I wrote a general audience book called "Ending ageing". One of the things that happens when you write a book like that, is that Coblert asked me to come on his show. That happened to me. I went on Colbert, and he said-- and you know the way he does things, so, he said like, how about risk? I'm not going to want to cross the street because it's going to be such a huge risk. I just said, look, that probably means your grandmother is going to be able to help you cross the stree tbecause she is still going to be healthy. This is the right way to think about it. We're actually going to take risks more seriously when there's unlimited longevity potential, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to be risk adverse as in staying in bed or avoiding anything that is currently risky because we have the second option of simply throwing money at the problem, in other words making the risky thing less risky so that we can still do it. Autonomous self-driving cars was my first example of that.

KB: Before we get into some of your ideas, what about all the things that have already happened that we hoped would extend our lifes? Modern medicine, antibiotics. All of these things should have helped extend our lives. But have they measurably done so? What makes you feel like your ideas will solve these problems and all of these other things, which are low tech in comparison but should have solved some of the problems?

AG: Fine question. I think the simple answer is that these things did significantly improve the situation. 200 years ago, the child mortality rate was 1/3rd even in the United States. Many people would die during child birth. This doesn't really happen anymore in the industrial world. Even in the developing world, those statistics are diminishing at an astonishing rate. The overall life expectancy in the world today, including all of the poorest countries of the world, is 72 years, which is 1 decade lower than the country with the most advanced life expectancy which is Japan. We are only just now putting proper effort into wondering how to address the problem of old age, now that they have only recently become the main problem.

KB: I think the life extension field is bifurcated into two spaces. One is people interested in healthspan, and some people who have your views-- and some people call you immortalists. What do the healthspan folks have wrong?

AG: This pisses me off like nothing on earth. The fact is that, yes, there's a huge amount of political bullshit about some sort of alleged dichotomy between the emphasis on healthy lifespan versus the emphasis on total lifespan. It's utter bullshit. The fact is, everybody should and really does know it's bullshit. It's just rhetoric. Everyone knows that lifespan is a side effect of health span. The main thing that people die of is, not being healthy. Therefore, you can't get away from the fact that on the one hand if you're not extending healthspan then there is no risk of extending lifespan. It's complete nonsense to suggest we shouldn't try to do this, because we should be scared that we'll become a "global nursing home" and we'd keep people alive in hospice everywhere around the world. It's just not going to happen. We have to look at the other side, too. Some people will want to be politically correct and say, we don't want people to live longer in total, we just want "compressed mortality". It's bullshit: if you can keep people healthy longer, then you are absolutely going to keep people alive longer. And that's a great thing, hello! People who are healthy, don't want to die tomorrow, irrespective of how long ago they were born.

KB: So you have seven molecular and cellular processes that you want to fix. Not everyone here is probably familiar with them. Why do you think these are the key to solving aging?

AG: Ageing is a combination of two processes. There's a process that goes on throughout life, literally throughout life, even before you are born. The entire huge complex network of processes that keep us alive from one day to the next, that network of processes generates changes to the molecular and cellular structure of the body. Those changes are harmless for a very long time until we're 50 years old or more. The reason why they are harmless is because the body is setup to tolerate that. But it's only setup to tolerate a certain amount of that change, because by the time we're 50 or 60 years old, evolution doesn't care about us anymore because we would have already reproduced by then and our genetic information has passed on. That progressive accumulation change to the microarchitecture of our bodies eventually exceeds the tolerance of our body and then it starts to decline until we can't function at all and then we die. That's all that ageing is. It's a lifelong process accumulating these changes, and I call those changes damage. The reason why I call it damage is because once they have exceeded that threshold of tolerance, then the second process kicks in and there's the emergence of pathologies or the decline in mental and physical faculties. The paradigm for dealing with this, for essentially uncoupling metabolism from this other-- like uncoupling being alive from being dead, that is all about repairing the damaging by doing periodic comprehensive preventative maintenance. In order to do that, you have to characterize and understand reasonably well what you're trying to target. What is the damage that accumulates? What changes are occurring in the molecular and cellular structures of the body? Nearly 20 years ago, I put forward a taxonomy of that damage or classification of that damage, which I thought was reasonably useful. It was a reasonably manageable taxonomy, with only 7 different categories, and secondly the reason why that classification was useful was because for each category we could actually describe a generic therapy or generic approach to eliminate that damage and repair that damage. When I say generic, I say that within each category there might be many examples in different tissues or organs of the body, where different cells undergo different chemical changes, but the approach to fixing it would be more or less the same. Once we would have done it a couple of times, we would have a handle on how to do it the next time more quickly for other types of damage. In more concrete terms, let me talk about stem cell therapies. One of the 7 types of damage back then that I talked about was cell death, and not being automatically replaced by the division of other cells. So there, you know, the number of cells is going down gradually over time and then eventually not growing enough cells to do the organ's job, and this drives some important aspects of ageing like Parkinson's disease. Stem cell therapy is the solution: you put stem cells into the body that are of the right type. I don't need to go through the other examples; this is just a simple illustration of what it's about. We're restoring, in that case, the number of cells to how it was in youth or young adults. In all of these cases, it's about restoring hte state, whether it's the number of cells or the contents inside of cells or the contents between cells. This concept was very heretical when I first put it forward 15-20 years ago. Over the course of the 2000s, I spent a lot of time educating my colleagues and bringing them to understand what I was really saying. This decade, it's been very heartening. A number of people have essentially reinvented the same idea and now it's totally mainstream. I am now pleased to say this is going to happen, although it's a question of how quickly.

KB: More than 15 years ago, you put a pretty aggressive timeline out there. You said, once we have a robust mouse model, it would be 15 years until we solve these problems. Right now I don't think we have that robust mouse model.

AG: Right, yes, this was another area where I took on my colleagues. It wasn't just a new paradigm. But I also felt my colleagues were being irresponsibly cowardly with regard the potential timeframe for progress. Many of my colleagues would say, one should not go out there and actually make predictions about how soon progress will be made, because that will engender unwarranted optimism or get people's hopes up. They wanted instead to underpromise and overdeliver. My view is the opposite: it's irresponsible to not put forward one's best guess about how these procedures are going to take or how long. If we don't, then non-experts are going to make up their own impressions and they are going to be even more wrong than we are, and they are going to be more pessimistic than us. We have spent the entire history of civilization kind of resigning ourselves and accomodating the fact that ageing is inevitable and immutable and all that. We're not predisposed to think otherwise, really. If you don't tell people, listen, things have changed, then people are going to carry on thinking things haven't changed. This means they aren't going to be particularly supportive of tax payer money being used on this research, because they would have no reason to believe the money would achieve anything. I believe experts in this area have an absolute duty to come out and say how long it is going to take. I started doing this maybe 15 years, like 2003-2004.
