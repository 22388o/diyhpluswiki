The future of biotech

Drew Endy

Michael Specter

JZ: These are literally two of my favorite people. Drew, whenever I get the chance to hang out with him... ... like seriously... and Michael, if I had somebody interview me about anything in my life, I could not ask for anyone else but Michael Specter. He's one of the most enjoyable people I've ever been able to talk wit hhim. I've been fortunate to be able to have lunch with him. Both of these guys are brilliant people and htey think outside of any boxes you have ever thought of. The last talk was hard to beat, that's the problem. I hope you all really enjoy this talk of Michael and Drew. Just really listen.

DE: Michael, you're a staff writer for The New Yorker. Is that right?

MS: Yes.

DE: ...

MS: ... Well ..

DE: Maybe one that ...

MS: Yes. I'm a staff writer. I've been writing a book about gene editing. It's been taking a lot longer than I thought.

DE: Gene editing, wasn't that invented in the 1970s?

MS: It was, but I'm slow.

DE: What's made it cool?

MS: You. There's a few technical aspects of biology. What I do think is more important, more challenging, is what the landscape of biotech is going to look like in 10, 20, 30 years from now. You guys talk about DIY and community and it's confusing to me. I would tell you, and this is going to sound like a weird thing to say... in 1994, a company called Calgene introduced... it was the first genetically modified... and it kind of.. it did one thing, which was.. grow rapidly. It stuck and they had a business. It went out of business because it sucked, not because people hated it or people hated the company. And, that, interested me because at some point after 1997, half of Americans, thought that this stuff was dangerous. And they still do. Facts don't matter. So I'm kind of looking at the role of genetic editing. We're all talking about genetic editing ourselves, or in small labs or small communities. Is that going to work? Some people are going to be delighted, but other people are going to freak out. What regulations are going to be created? There will have to be some. Drew?

DE: What are you really asking?

MS: How are we going to control these freaky people?

Q: YEAH! Biohack the planet!

DE: The same way that we control Bob Dylan.

MS: How's that?

DE: The same way we control speech or poetry. It's not the framework we've inherited. If you think of biology as a generative substrate where you can implement creative thoughts, then there's an infinite combinations of things that can be realized so it's an open-ended domain. My view on things is that we exist in a time where a certain type of press is being created, for transmuting human intentions into biological matter whether hman editing or DNA editing-- it's a time of press.  Language is a system for translating human intentions from one system to another, whether us using english, me using python, it can be uothers using an un-yet unnamed language... And then the question becomes, how does one govern the press and speech? Although we use the label "free speech" in the US, that's not really what we mean-- speech is heavily constrained, like Ohio... having to do with obscenity... and lawlessness. And so, what's interesting about these cases is that they don't say in any particular instance that this speec his protected or not but they created a framework that allows for local context to be included in the consideration of whether it's okay to go ahead and say something. I think there's a point of departure that looking at these two cases in particular is a good way to change thinking in part because ... is doing this in biology likely to be considered obscene, yes or no? This can be defined in a particular context- perhaps in an academic institution, but not in a community lab. It might be something that incites lawlessness, in which case it shouldn't be okay.

MS: I agree with you that a lot of those cases make sense as reference points. This is about spoken langauage. It's an analogy, biotech is different. How are we going to deal with the obscene and the things that we are worried about, like error? Things are going to get fucked up. That's okay. But, when you say, well, let's regulate it in the way that we regulate speech. There's a guy in here trying to make a drug, but...what do we do? Do we call the police? Do we do a tribunal? Or do we just say cool?

DE: What do you do if someone publishes an article in a magazine and it causes people to go out and cause harm? How do you hold the author of that article accountable?

MS: It depends. But I do think it's worth thinking about this. I don't think this is what we're talking about.

DE: ... the last time.. the army or the navy... yeah. It's real interesting. We had just got ourselves in a local trap going full Hausian and, ... and I think the reason here is warping in a self-reflective way. Everything implied by what you have heard rpeviously and things represented in a scalable governance for distributing responsibility... is one in which people wish to do something constructive, and the upside of that is under selection, to outweigh what could happen otherwise. The internet is likely to work tomorrow. It's likely to be the case that I can use email tomorrow, and while my computer crashes and hard drives crash, there's so many collective incentives for the internet to ebe working. So many people can become local heroes restoring internet connectivity. The reason why the intenret will work tomorrow is because most people wish for it to work tomorrow. If you want to talk about the bionet and the biosphere, then to the same extent that we're getting better at inserting our intentions into biology, then I think we need toconstruct a culture to do this.

MS: There has been 2 trillion doses of... consumed by humans. There's never been a documented case where that has caused harm. 46% of Americans do everything they can to avoid GMO, though. I'm not talking about what's right or what we all in this room or other rational people think will work. I'm talking about the way that people express themselves and think. All this crap about designer babies is crap except that people talk about it all the time.

DE: Let me try to interpret that. Sounds like there's a lot of abstractions,l and even if we make things incrementally better and distribute them and what can be realized is more and more actually awesome... then these inherited wedge issues or distracting topics will prevent anything supercool from spontaneously coming true?

MS: I don't feel that it "will". I feel we have a chance now, we came up with toothpaste and GMOs but we're still at a point where society is not toally freaking out. Some people are going to freak out sure, but we're still at a point where people can be influenced in value this kind of thing. Some of the things in my book are things like, the .... the editing... ... edit.. malarial mosquitos in Africa... and I've been to Mali and I've talked to actual witchhunters there. Actual witchhunters.

DE: Where does the hate come from?

MS: France. Most of the reasons these countries hate that... the previous colonial folks told them to hate them. Let me finish this. When you talk to these people in Mali about editing mosquitoes, I never heard-- I've never found anyone that said no we don't wnat to do that. Everyone knows someone who has died from malaria and it means something to them. I think this is different. We have to spend more time trying to figure out how to do that, and not wake up in 20 years and have this stupid fucking machinery.

Q: I'm super stoked. There's two things in life I'm excited about: science communication and science. You are a scientist, and you're a communicator. How do we prevent the fear of science in people who don't know science? It's in the way that we communicate science to people. In highschool, I learned things that my parents never learned. It's this fear of unknown that is propagated over a certain number of years. If oyu understand it, then it gets better. As a scientist journalist... and scientists do a terrible job of talking about science.

MS: If you did a good job at that, then I wouldn't have a job.   I'd like to see kids doing editing genes and swapping genes out. There's no reason not to be aggressive about that. But they aren't doing that. We can make up in 20 years and suddenly say, wow we really should have done htat. This is too big, this is too important. We're talking about controlling life, changing life.

DE: I feel like, as someone who has spent a lot of time talking about this issue, I feel like most of that time has been wasted. My suspicion is that outside of a very few small number of edge cases, a lot of the conversation could just be skipped and reality could be constructed. The cost of the conversation that happens which mostly doesn't yield anything, is an opportunity cost. You spend your time on it, and also, it keeps everybody from acknowledging what might actually change. Daisy Ginsberg made a nice observation: the synthetic biology revolutionaries... that they promise... say we could engineer you but everything stays the same, it doesn't make sense. There's a puzzle: we're working towards operational mastery of living matter. And that's kind of a big deal. If you don't allow for the possibility of what seems like the extreme likelihood that many things could change structurally like supply chains and power relationships, and if you don't allow for that, and try to placate the inherited stalled conversations, then you're propagating status quo power relationships into the future to make things stay the same. I don't know what to do about the worry. Except for a few edge cases, I'd rather just go build things that are true. Including the cultural politics, but not try to spend too much time trying to make people feel happy about it. When things change, not everyone is going to be happy about it.

MS: I just don't want people to be irrationally afraid about it. Do you think it's a fair analogy that the ... the PC revolution.. that this is any way a fair analogy? I don't think anyone in this room thinks the future of biology should be controlled by... a few people in Palo Alto.

DE: There are a few puzzles here. By the time we got homebrew computing in 1975, we were 30 years into massive federal sustained investments into computing infrastructure. Texas Instruments went from catching reflections off the ground for oil, to a submarine detection company during ww2 for the navy. And from that, it got some investments to develop wafers. By the time you got to the point of transistor logic data plucks and composable logic elements in the 60s and 70s, you're many $100s of millions of dollars of public investments into electronics infrastructure. By the time you got to the time of Dell, things were composable at a significant scale. When someone was talking about building a cell right now, things aren't composable that much right now. The investment hasn't been done yet. There's a wish there, which is well-intentioned, but the sustained investments in getting the engineering infrastructure in place hasn't been three. Nobody wants to say "yeah let's militarize biology" like we did electronics to pay for it. So there's a puzzle. There's another puzzle, which is about industrialization. For a few hundred years now, we've been operating in the context of centralized manufacturing and efficiencies from certain scales of operation had become normal, and with the internet showing up, supply chains about that are going gangbusters. Biology in its current form is growing up in this context. If you look at the national strategy about how to structure investments in biotech, they are getting titles like "industrialization of biology" but the irony is that biology is a pre-distributed thing. And so the cliches on twitter is that even though the report says industrialization of biology, it's really about biologizing industry, but that's just on twitte.r The capital, though, is flowing in the way of working such that most of the money is going to big companies in a few isolated locations. I think it would be interesting to say maybe this is something that community labs could pick up or the dog breeders could pick up, how does one structure flow of capital to developthe technical infrastructure to support distributed biomanufacturing? We have plenty of existence proofs in biology, but we haven't mapped biology into that domain. We don't have the infrastructure yet, and capital flow selects for centralized intensive capacities.
