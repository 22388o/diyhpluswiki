JZ: These are literally two of my favorite people. Drew, whenever I get the chance to hang out with him... ... like seriously... and Michael, if I had somebody interview me about anything in my life, I could not ask for anyone else but Michael Specter. He's one of the most enjoyable people I've ever been able to talk wit hhim. I've been fortunate to be able to have lunch with him. Both of these guys are brilliant people and htey think outside of any boxes you have ever thought of. The last talk was hard to beat, that's the problem. I hope you all really enjoy this talk of Michael and Drew. Just really listen.

DE: Michael, you're a staff writer for The New Yorker. Is that right?

MS: Yes.

DE: ...

MS: ... Well ..

DE: Maybe one that ...

MS: Yes. I'm a staff writer. I've been writing a book about gene editing. It's been taking a lot longer than I thought.

DE: Gene editing, wasn't that invented in the 1970s?

MS: It was, but I'm slow.

DE: What's made it cool?

MS: You. There's a few technical aspects of biology. What I do think is more important, more challenging, is what the landscape of biotech is going to look like in 10, 20, 30 years from now. You guys talk about DIY and community and it's confusing to me. I would tell you, and this is going to sound like a weird thing to say... in 1994, a company called Calgene introduced... it was the first genetically modified... and it kind of.. it did one thing, which was.. grow rapidly. It stuck and they had a business. It went out of business because it sucked, not because people hated it or people hated the company. And, that, interested me because at some point after 1997, half of Americans, thought that this stuff was dangerous. And they still do. Facts don't matter. So I'm kind of looking at the role of genetic editing. We're all talking about genetic editing ourselves, or in small labs or small communities. Is that going to work? Some people are going to be delighted, but other people are going to freak out. What regulations are going to be created? There will have to be some. Drew?

DE: What are you really asking?

MS: How are we going to control these freaky people?

Q: YEAH! Biohack the planet!

DE: The same way that we control Bob Dylan.

MS: How's that?

DE: The same way we control speech or poetry. It's not the framework we've inherited. If you think of biology as a generative substrate where you can implement creative thoughts, then there's an infinite combinations of things that can be realized so it's an open-ended domain. My view on things is that we exist in a time where a certain type of press is being created, for transmuting human intentions into biological matter whether hman editing or DNA editing-- it's a time of press.  Language is a system for translating human intentions from one system to another, whether us using english, me using python, it can be uothers using an un-yet unnamed language... And then the question becomes, how does one govern the press and speech? Although we use the label "free speech" in the US, that's not really what we mean-- speech is heavily constrained, like Ohio... having to do with obscenity... and lawlessness. And so, what's interesting about these cases is that they don't say in any particular instance that this speec his protected or not but they created a framework that allows for local context to be included in the consideration of whether it's okay to go ahead and say something. I think there's a point of departure that looking at these two cases in particular is a good way to change thinking in part because ... is doing this in biology likely to be considered obscene, yes or no? This can be defined in a particular context- perhaps in an academic institution, but not in a community lab. It might be something that incites lawlessness, in which case it shouldn't be okay.

MS: I agree with you that a lot of those cases make sense as reference points. This is about spoken langauage. It's an analogy, biotech is different. How are we going to deal with the obscene and the things that we are worried about, like error? Things are going to get fucked up. That's okay. But, when you say, well, let's regulate it in the way that we regulate speech. There's a guy in here trying to make a drug, but...what do we do? Do we call the police? Do we do a tribunal? Or do we just say cool?

DE: What do you do if someone publishes an article in a magazine and it causes people to go out and cause harm? How do you hold the author of that article accountable?

MS: It depends. But I do think it's worth thinking about this. I don't think this is what we're talking about.

DE: ... the last time.. the army or the navy... yeah. It's real interesting. We had just got ourselves in a local trap going full Hausian and, ... and I think the reason here is warping in a self-reflective way. Everything implied by what you have heard rpeviously and things represented in a scalable governance for distributing responsibility... is one in which people wish to do something constructive, and the upside of that is under selection, to outweigh what could happen otherwise. The internet is likely to work tomorrow. It's likely to be the case that I can use email tomorrow, and while my computer crashes and hard drives crash, there's so many collective incentives for the internet to ebe working. So many people can become local heroes restoring internet connectivity. The reason why the intenret will work tomorrow is because most people wish for it to work tomorrow. If you want to talk about the bionet and the biosphere, then to the same extent that we're getting better at inserting our intentions into biology, then I think we need toconstruct a culture to do this.

MS: There has been 2 trillion doses of... consumed by humans. There's never been a documented case where that has caused harm. 46% of Americans do everything they can to avoid GMO, though. I'm not talking about what's right or what we all in this room or other rational people think will work. I'm talking about the way that people express themselves and think. All this crap about designer babies is crap except that people talk about it all the time.

DE: Let me try to interpret that. Sounds like there's a lot of abstractions,l and even if we make things incrementally better and distribute them and what can be realized is more and more actually awesome... then these inherited wedge issues or distracting topics will prevent anything supercool from spontaneously coming true?

MS: I don't feel that it "will". I feel we have a chance now, we came up with toothpaste and GMOs but we're still at a point where society is not toally freaking out. Some people are going to freak out sure, but we're still at a point where people can be influenced in value this kind of thing. Some of the things in my book are things like, the .... the editing... ... edit.. malarial mosquitos in Africa... and I've been to Mali and I've talked to actual witchhunters there. Actual witchhunters.

DE: Where does the hate come from?

MS: France. Most of the reasons these countries hate that... the previous colonial folks told them to hate them. Let me finish this. When you talk to these people in Mali about editing mosquitoes, I never heard-- I've never found anyone that said no we don't wnat to do that. Everyone knows someone who has died from malaria and it means something to them. I think this is different. We have to spend more time trying to figure out how to do that, and not wake up in 20 years and have this stupid fucking machinery.

Q: I'm super stoked. There's two things in life I'm excited about: science communication and science. You are a scientist, and you're a communicator. How do we prevent the fear of science in people who don't know science? It's in the way that we communicate science to people. In highschool, I learned things that my parents never learned. It's this fear of unknown that is propagated over a certain number of years. If oyu understand it, then it gets better. As a scientist journalist... and scientists do a terrible job of talking about science.

MS: If you did a good job at that, then I wouldn't have a job.   I'd like to see kids doing editing genes and swapping genes out. There's no reason not to be aggressive about that. But they aren't doing that. We can make up in 20 years and suddenly say, wow we really should have done htat. This is too big, this is too important. We're talking about controlling life, changing life.

DE: I feel like, as someone who has spent a lot of time talking about this issue, I feel like most of that time has been wasted. My suspicion is that outside of a very few small number of edge cases, a lot of the conversation could just be skipped and reality could be constructed. The cost of the conversation that happens which mostly doesn't yield anything, is an opportunity cost. You spend your time on it, and also, it keeps everybody from acknowledging what might actually change. Daisy Ginsberg made a nice observation: the synthetic biology revolutionaries... that they promise... say we could engineer you but everything stays the same, it doesn't make sense. There's a puzzle: we're working towards operational mastery of living matter. And that's kind of a big deal. If you don't allow for the possibility of what seems like the extreme likelihood that many things could change structurally like supply chains and power relationships, and if you don't allow for that, and try to placate the inherited stalled conversations, then you're propagating status quo power relationships into the future to make things stay the same. I don't know what to do about the worry. Except for a few edge cases, I'd rather just go build things that are true. Including the cultural politics, but not try to spend too much time trying to make people feel happy about it. When things change, not everyone is going to be happy about it.

MS: I just don't want people to be irrationally afraid about it. Do you think it's a fair analogy that the ... the PC revolution.. that this is any way a fair analogy? I don't think anyone in this room thinks the future of biology should be controlled by... a few people in Palo Alto.

DE: There are a few puzzles here. By the time we got homebrew computing in 1975, we were 30 years into massive federal sustained investments into computing infrastructure. Texas Instruments went from catching reflections off the ground for oil, to a submarine detection company during ww2 for the navy. And from that, it got some investments to develop wafers. By the time you got to the point of transistor logic data plucks and composable logic elements in the 60s and 70s, you're many $100s of millions of dollars of public investments into electronics infrastructure. By the time you got to the time of Dell, things were composable at a significant scale. When someone was talking about building a cell right now, things aren't composable that much right now. The investment hasn't been done yet. There's a wish there, which is well-intentioned, but the sustained investments in getting the engineering infrastructure in place hasn't been three. Nobody wants to say "yeah let's militarize biology" like we did electronics to pay for it. So there's a puzzle. There's another puzzle, which is about industrialization. For a few hundred years now, we've been operating in the context of centralized manufacturing and efficiencies from certain scales of operation had become normal, and with the internet showing up, supply chains about that are going gangbusters. Biology in its current form is growing up in this context. If you look at the national strategy about how to structure investments in biotech, they are getting titles like "industrialization of biology" but the irony is that biology is a pre-distributed thing. And so the cliches on twitter is that even though the report says industrialization of biology, it's really about biologizing industry, but that's just on twitte.r The capital, though, is flowing in the way of working such that most of the money is going to big companies in a few isolated locations. I think it would be interesting to say maybe this is something that community labs could pick up or the dog breeders could pick up, how does one structure flow of capital to developthe technical infrastructure to support distributed biomanufacturing? We have plenty of existence proofs in biology, but we haven't mapped biology into that domain. We don't have the infrastructure yet, and capital flow selects for centralized intensive capacities.

Q: We have billions of years of source code out there. There's tons of vulnerabilities. It pretty much runs but people are afraid of touching it. What strategies could we make, possibly informed by our misadventures in software, what could we do to mitigate the risks and maybe this dovetails into what you were talking about- is there a way to say that distributed biological capability is something that we need, specifically if we were to create a global immune system, or from software being able to deploy offensive technologies? What mitigations can we deploy?

MS: One of the things that .... responsible for... is this analogizing... this is a revolutionary new way of looking at things. We shouldn't just slap on and say "it's like computer processors" or "it's like software" or anything that we want or even biology before. I really do think, I don't see a strategy at all, for people to understand what may happen in the near distant future. Even things like the genetic modification of mice.. which could get rid of a significant problem... it's causing a lot of anxiety. 

DE: I have a lot to say about that question. But first let's hear another question.

KG: I have a question from the livestream. Somoene asks, Drew, would you be interested in having a conversation/debate with Jim Thomas from ETC Group like the one you had a decade ago at the long now foundation? Would you be interested in revisiting the predictions you made?

DE: Sure, happy to. Jim and I were... had a meeting at the quaker friend house up in Toronto up in December put on by the world council of churches. It was a 3-day intensive conversation about synthetic biology and agriculture and food production. ETC was one of the co-organizers and they had one reps of all of the major world religions as well as various native peoples and so on. It was a great conversation. I learned a lot. I would welcome a debate or any type of conversation with people who have different views. I learned from a vanilla farmer in Mexico how they experienced the rise of synthetic chemistry and artificial vanilla as it relates to the cultivation of vanilla plants in the forest and how they adapted to that and how they returned to something previously... they valued the relationship with land more than they valued money, and relationships with each other, and learning that they have done some interesting things. There were also some disagreements. One of the points in the room last December in Toronto was a team that wanted to ban gene drives, like amplifying genetic casettes that might be released in the environment. I was presented this in the context of a circle of friends. I hear what you're saying- ban is a strong word, be careful when you use it. I'm interested in banning prayer.... so what do you say about that? Well we got to talking, and certain kinds of public prayer have been banned in a particular way, and that resonated and we had a disconnect that resulted in a connection. The prior topic-- the interpretation of the question in part has to do with security and how one does biosecurity. I look at biology as an open distributed network operating on a natural itmescale and things are sharing atoms and information and people can interface with that and you're trying to secure a network and some mal-intentioned network wants to cause harm. You don't know how long you have to respond, but the adversaries have unlimited time to find exploits. This is not unlike other adversary situations in other contexts. There's significant centralized capacities of knowledge and combined with dissemination of that knowledge, like the NSA. We often remark that how one might reformat their family doesn't really make sense, but I would like to see more cluefulness and sustained energy in people working together to tackle biosecurity. At a public level, once you get the centralized powers that be in the government sphere, it's difficult to sustain the conversations due to the public liability revealed by Michael's case where it is uncomfortable to admit that there are these problems coming in. Any time anyone in a political position tries to talk outloud about what is happening in biology, that happens. That doesn't help anyone. Something missing in this conversation but it's implied in everything coming before this evening is, what type of society do we want to be part of? Do we want to be consumers of technologies? Where we are subjects of networks and relationships? Where we are objects within systems? Or do we want to be a society of citizens? In this context, I mean citizens not with respect to national immigration or frothy short-term politics but I mean citizens in terms of rights and responsibilities and access to capacities. To the extent that we can renew a conversation about what it means to be a citizen to be a part of society, then this allows us to engage in a more direct and modest way on the topic of how are we going to develop strategy and make sure tha teach of us have the option of fluourishing in the ways that are meaningful to each of us. This is often missing. But everyone gets caught up in reactionary politics about safety and normative values.

MS: In the context of gene drives... there's more discussion in open science and the world of people of scientists and participants, than there ever has been. It can go a lot further and it should go a lot further. I do think that people are talking about this,... in a way tha tthey have not before. And I think this should be improved.

Q: I have a question. I can't tell you how many people have talked about bioterrorists or whatever. Will Alzheimers medication be made or whatever. How do you communicate through your idea of biology being a right of free speech to people who are not even interested in lab spaces- inaccessible to community labs? Do you think it will die out with older generations being afraid of it? Or will the fear be sustained with younger generations?

MS: I would be willing to die out as a sacrifice. I think the word science communicator is... I think it's important to talk to people honestly. This is an exciting field and there's lots of dragons and curing cancer and all sorts of cool stuff. I think many of those things, are eventually possible. We need to reel in our expectations. I've been around a while. Often reporters get ahead of reality. People who don't understand science, just grasp on to the latest thing they have heard. It's really important. I've talked to scientists a lot.  Scientists think their job is to be on the bench and that's enough to be a good scientist. I'm sorry to say, that's not enough anymore. Every single person in the lab needs to explain to everyone what their lab does. If nobody in the lab can talk to anybody outside, then that's a disaster waiting to happen. You need to have communication, and you need to have reality checks. Every single day, CRISPR cures another disease. I think it will cure some diseases, but so far, nobody is cured. I can show you thousands of... literally every day, ... so, we need to ....
