Andrew Hessel

LC: I am a computer architect. I make computers more efficient, faster, and do new applications. I've been fascinated by biology. For the past 4 years I've been exploring ways to use molecular biology to build better computers, such as DNA data storage and information process.

AH: Are you a biohacker?

LC: I don't know.

AH: I think we're all biohackers here. I am Andrew Hessel. I've had a bizzare path through science. I started in computers and quickly realized I don't care about computers. They are powerful tools. I decided I would start to hack biology and I switched my program into cell and molecular biology and genetics. I am a bottom-up guy. I want to understand how it works from the bottom. If I was top down then I think I would have become a physician. I spent 7 years in Amgen, a major biopharmaceutical ocmpany. I realized how broken drug development is. I left Amgen and then went into the synthetic biology world and I had no aim without an institution and I was just watching this community appear and start to grow and flourish because it just seemed like watching the semiconductor industry boot up in the 1950s. It was incredibly interesting. I just finished a 6 year stint at Autodesk trying to get them to do CAD tools for biology. Recnetly I've been involved in a few projects including gp-write which is the synthetic biology of the human genome project. We want to write a human genome and other large genomes. I have a DNA synthesizer tech project that we're looking for funding on and we have a small seed stage startup called Humane Genomics where we're making synthetic viruses to fight a type of dog cancer called osteosarcoma. I identify as a biohacker but I look digitally and I try to share everything I learn and make sure that all the resources are available for everyone etc.

LC: I find it interesting to think there's incredible intersection between electronics and biology. It's designing systems to have biological components in them. Let me give you an example. CMOS is very fast. We are at 7nm now. You might have heard that announcement. We can do self-assembly of atomically precise structures.

JZ: Why do we want it smaller?

LC: Smaller is faster.

JZ: What's the theoretical limit?

LC: Some people say 3nm might work. Nobody is sure.

AH: Biology is ground up, built from molecular materials.

LC: Molecular assembly is any engineer's dreams to specify what you want to build and it comes out of the structure. We did a calculation once htat looked at if you were going to build a protein to the work of a transistor does, so, any ... and you project out the most efficient transistor, a protein is simply 10,000 more energy efficient to do the same job as a transistor. We need this to make AI more scary.

JZ: So will our cell phones have proteins in them?

AH: Did Drew Endy make it out here yesterday?

JZ: Yes.

AH: I asked Drew years ago about what he was working on. And he said he was trying to make cell phones. It's aspirationlal but I don't see any reason why you couldn't use synthetic biology to make a cell phone in the future. Imagine dropping out a virus and getting a cell phone in your head.

JZ: Or a shake-and-bake cell phone in your fridge.

LC: So you are working on gp-write and I'm working on DNA data storage to try to improve DNA synthesis costs down to zero and throughput to infinity. It's interesting to see how those two intersection. My naieve view is that when you're talking about DNA data storage what you want to do si...

JZ: What is DNA data storage?

LC: Okay, most of you have heard of it. Okay. The idea is to use DNA molecules as a storage medium. DNA is very general. It can store information. The idea is to develop a way to map digital data to sequences and manufacture those...

JZ: How many terabytes are stored in your body?

LC: It depends on what you mean.

JZ: If a human was a hard drive, how much? What is an exabyte?

LC: It's 10^18 bytes. Kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabytes, exabyte, zettabyte, yottabyte, hellabyte, ((and then brontobytes)). For this to work, DNA synthesis needs to be super cheap. It's different for genome synthesis vs DNA data storage.

JZ: Andrew, when are you going to synthesize a human genome?

AH: A little bit of backstory.. I've been trying t owrite viral genomes for the past few years. It's been a little frustrating. Viruses have the smallest genomes. They are not really alive. They are kind of like USB sticks. They need a cell to actually operate. The viral genome start arounde 3000 bits of code and the largest virus ever is like 1.8 million nucleotides. Much of them are under 200k bits of code. I wanted to build synthetic viruses from scratch since I read the first paper in 2002. In 2007, I found a few groups that would synthesize a virus provided you didn't seem too scary. It took until 2014 when I synthesized the first virus personally using resources that are avialable to me at Autodesk at the time. That was PhiX174. It was just over 5000 bits of code. That took several weeks to get synthesized.

JZ: When you mean bits you mean bases?

AH: Bases are bits, not bytes. Then we moved on to adenovirus which is 34,000 bits. THat took 8 weeks to synthesize and assemble. I realize this is so incredibly frustrating and slow that I started to arguing it was time for a new genome project. Essentially focus on synthesis tech so that we can lower the cost of doing it and set the bar high and get a tide that raises all ships. It's been a fascinating ride. It turns out that scientists don't work on core technologies for the most part. That's engineering. When the scientists that we pull together to advance the gp-write project, they said look, we have to create big pilot projects that will be synthesis-heavy to create a pull for the tech to be created. When we get funded it's based on novel discoveries not engineering novel equipment. It's been fascinating wtatching the dynamics there. The ultimate goal of gp-write is to develop the tools and technologies and standarsds and ethics around engineering large genomes and lowering the cost of doing this by at least a factor of 1000x. It will get a lot cheaper over time, but it will have to start somewhere. I want to create cheap virus genomes for gene therapy.

LC: What is the size of these synthetic virus genomes?

AH: Ideally you want it as close as they can be to the design. But biology is a little flexible. There's error correction systems. Today I expect the next generation of DNA synthesizers...

JZ: How far away are we from synthesizing a human genome?

AH: You can't do that yet. You can't do that... it's cost. Making oligos is really cheap today and you can do it at scale.

LC: Not at scale.

AH: It's the assembly processes of stringing together oligos together into longer strands of DNA is slow and costly and requires a lot of error checking. Viral genomes, we're getting faster. You can turnaround a viral genome in 48 hours if you have the right equipment,. but that's with a lot of invested capital. Doing it outsourced, it will take a few weeks.

LC: What about making it fully automated with an assembly process?

AH: I believe that... we make DNA chemically right now, which is not the way DNA do it. We're starting to see the first few papers of DNA enzymatic synthesis methods. We haven't demonstrated enough control of the enszymatic process to get it to the bit level. I believe the intersection of electronic circuits and the intersection of the biological machinery is the most exciting area to do biohacking today. Making electronics cheap and accessible available to everyone that even foundries are available to people today. The biology- if you're not trying to tweak and modify it, it's going ot be interesting ot start to do that integration. You can attach e3nzymes to chips, you're going to start seeing the ability to, and then we've beengetting these cyborg chips ilke the ion terorrent and nanopore.

LC: The fascinating thing to think about is designing large-scale systems with a dry component and a wet component. Suppose we make DNA data storage. You're going to have all your data and seflies and cat pics all stored in a long time in a dat a center. But now you need a data center that has fluidics in it. One of hte technologies I find interesting is digital microfluidics. The idea is electrowetting, moving droplets on a surface in an arbitrary way, and the nyou can treat them as carriers of biological information. You can scale tha tup and what woul dthe data ccenter footprint look like? Could you make a Walmart sized building full of tiny picoliter droplets? That's the scale that we need to think about for doing computers with molecular components. It's the scale you need to think about doing global scale population sequencing and sample handling/manipulation. What if you do this for 10 million or 10 billion people-- this sample manipulation on this scale is just fascinatong to think about.

JZ: I'm skeptical. Our cell phones heat up because the components.. you talk about putting something biological in there like putting a DNA dat astorage...
