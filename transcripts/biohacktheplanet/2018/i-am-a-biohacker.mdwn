# Opening remarks 1

There are refreshments in the back. There is beer for people who are of age. There's also canned wine. Again for people who are of age. Alright, alright. Zayner in the house. We have tons of refreshments for you guys. We have cold beer because scientists are socially awkward. Welcome to Biohack the Planet 2018. Velkom. We have people from Missippi. We have people from the Bay Area. Please have a seat. Please silence your cell phones.

We want to thank Founders Fund and Encryptgen and osfund for funding this year. A lot of biohacker grants were awarded this year, cash money. Also we have donated towards the Omni. All the chairs you are sitting on were purchased and cleaned and vacuumed. Without further adue, I'm going to introduce Josiah Zayner.

... Peter, Mycah and some ohter people. OBviously I couldn't put this thing on alone. I tried the first year but that failed. There's so many people who have hleped out with this. The Omni Commons of course. They let us use this space and it's really inexpensive. Counter Culture Labs is the bioahcker space in the back. This conference this year is a little bit different... if anoyone knows me, I hate doing the same things that everyone else does. I can't stand it. People give talks at conferences- we don't do that. What we're going to do is, we're going to do conversations throughout this whole conference. That means two people sitting up here with some scotch or tequila and just have a conversation. There will be a microphone up here and a wireless mic running around. Just ask questions that you want to ask-- you should be able to interact with all of these people. We will interact with them and with each other and hopefuly we'll have a good entertaining time. Hopefully, yeah.

Before we start, I wish I had some intro music. Any chance of that? Maybe some AC/DC. Anything would be great. Tomorrow the schedule is going to be-- there's some crazy stuff happening. In the last 3 days, we've had a few speakers cancel. We've survived. The schedule tomorrow will be a little bit wonky but it will all be amazing entertaining people that you will be able to listen to. It will all be great. Here we go.

I was trying to get you guys pumped up. It's not working. Esther was awesome. What we did is, we hid some prizes under the seats. Look under your seats, and if you find something here... if you find anything... A pipette. Oh my god. Wow, a pipette. You get a pipette, you get a pipette, you get a pipette. Thank you Ester, thank you for the hype. I really needed that. Anyway, we'll just start.

The first discussion we'll have is between two people you may not be familiar with. One is David Ishee and the other is Keoni Gandall. We have two people. We're going to have a discussion. These are pretty infamous people. Both of them have no college education and they are doing some synthetic biology, genetic engineering work. They can probably talk about themselves a lot better than I could. Please introduce yourselves and have a conversation.

# Talk

DI: I am David Ishee. I am a dog breeder. I've spent the last 3 years... recently branching out to tweaking on myself. That's sort of me.

KG: Hello. I am Keoni Gandall. My goal is to make biotech more accessible to people. To make biotechnology something that anyone can work with or anyone can modify and build and create. Over the last year or so, I've been working with the Biobricks Foundation for free genes for people. Basically, my goal is to make it so that anyone fcan genetically modiufy any organism they want without any prior knowledge or without going through a lot of expensive formal training. Just making that accessible to everyone.

DI: You say that... 

KG: The Biobricks Foundation is not associated with iGEM. It was founded by the same folks, some of which are here.

DI: So it's not iGEM?

KG: iGEM does a lot of things right but they do a few things wrong as well. They make it very expensive and the expense of going to iGEM is only going up not down. This makes it so that a lot of biohackers or biohacker labs or just people wanting to biohack themselves can't afford to go to iGEM. They are throwing that community under the rug.

DI: I looked at it once. It was like $5k to go to iGEM. So nevermind.

KG: Their parts registry is great. But not just iGEM should have access to that technology. Everyone should be able to have access to that DNA. They don't right now.

DI: ... just big institutions.

KG: I don't want that. Opposite world.

DI: You've been doing the thing with free genes, then. How is that been going?

KG: Yes. Good.

DI: Could you expand on that?

KG: It's been ramping up. Really getting good at making... something that I think everyone here is... automate yourself away, try to make it so that everything can be done by robots. You just setup a robot and then you can get your friend's protocols or your collaborators protocols. Everyone is sharing the same stuff, protocols, DNA, or robots.

DI: But that doesn't work.

KG: Some day it will. It's a small robot. Like the size of htis table.

DI: Oh, I could probably squeeze that in.

KG: do you want to make genetically engineered mamamls accessible to everyone?

DI: Oh, yeah. The first people I would want to work with are dog breeders. They have been genetically modifying dogs for 40,000 years. It's one of the oldest longest running genetic engineering experiment we have. We're using the same tools that we were using 40,000 years ago. We started doing this before agriculture and the tools haven't changed since then. There's room for improvement. You have over 600 different genetic diseases and some of them are just crazy perfect for CRISPR and things like that. Like in Dalmations-- three bases upstream of a PAM site is a single point mutation which is begging for cas9. The problem is that it's expensive, and it's tricky, and it's just not a skillset necessarily that dog breeders have. I want to show dog breeders that they can do it. And figure out a way that they could do it quickly.

KG: Could the same tech be used on humans?

DI: Actually I tried that. The same buffers kill human sperm. With a few tweaks, it could work.

Q: How did you make the human sperm?

DI: The old fashion way.

KG: How does that work in dogs? What's going on?

DI: Over the last couple of years... but it was really early. They get big, then get smaller, make milk, then stop making milk. I think this was because I was using luc the set.... several enzymes, ... I think that was the issue, so I swapped it with something simpler. But I've been optimizing my protocol, so now it's at 90% of the sperm get modified. So hopefully that's the most... We have 2 females pregnant right now, we'll know in October. Two females.

KG: Where can we find more information about that?

DI: Uh, facebook mostly. I should probably blog or something. You could just go to my website or find me on facebook. ((It's an uncool website he has.))

KG: What inspires you most?

DI: Let's see. Honestly, it's other people in the biohacking community. I see people doing crazy stuff. I got started because I saw someone do a TED talk. I see people in the community who are.... and then... other people are just-- there's just so much amazing stuff going on that people are getting some results. Some of this stuff is really advanced and really hard stuff. And people are putting in the time and the effort and making it work. That's what inspires me to keep drilling in. What about you?

KG: Mine is a little bit more abstract, not really personal. I'm really inspired by the computer revolution that happened in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. The generation of computer software going from a model of like "we don't know what we're doing" still using vacuum tubes to the point where we have Linux and a whole operating syste mfor free that you can install on any laptop.

DI: Are we closer to vacuum tubes or closer to Linux? In biology?

KG: In biology, we are at vacuum tubes right now. We need to get to Linux. Right now you have two paths that aren't mutually exclusive-- a path driven by large corporate interests like pharma is really interested in synthetic biology for drug production, and we have another path which can be a grassroots method for indvidiauls interested in solving their problems in their local communities. Hopefully, right now, we're still on one path mainly where large corporations and big pharma gets ton of funding to do synthetic biology in their own biofoundries right next to MIT that aren't really sharing a lot of the stuff that they do. What I want to see happen is more of a grassroots movement where individuals are empowered to make a change in their local environments or communities, just like people in the original software revolution were able to do so.

DI: Right now... biohackers run into problems like nobody has any money, funding, equipment, reagents, everyone is struggling with barely getting what they need. You have a job, and then you spend nights and weekends.
