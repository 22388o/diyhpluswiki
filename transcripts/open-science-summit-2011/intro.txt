Welcome to the second open science summit (applause). I want to give a quick thank you to the folks who are helping out this year and supporting us. For our open science champions: patrick, luke nosek, brian glans, tonya jones from sens, kevin pero from h-et. I just want to amke a special note of our dining provided by Kachina Davinit. It's a restaurant across the street, they do a good job and you will enjoy that. We're going to go ahead and keep things moving along fairly strictly so if we things get out of control, we're going to whistle obnoxiously in a sustained way to get things done. Kadesha is going to take that duty on so that I can be the nice guy that I am (laughter). First off, the first presentation is Victoria Stodden. We'l llet you get it going (applause).
