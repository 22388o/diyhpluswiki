My name is Nick Shockey. I am irector of the right to research coalition. At risk of preaching to the choir. I hope we are all clear about the basics about the basics and why open access is importand and what students are doing. 

To make sure abuout this, I think we are all in the same page about what open access is. What we mean is that it's free, unrestricted scholarship and the rights to use this information to the fullest possible extent. there are four paths to this. Therei s publishing in open access journals, the golden route. There's over 7k open access journals. We pased the 7k mark in September. Today I think we are over 7200 journals. There are many like PLOS and Nature Publishing is entering like one new journal called Scientific Reports, taking over the PLOS One model. You can find a full list of the journals upon the DOAJ website.

"Open access has been at the heart of NPG's expansion for the last two years.. of the five new journals, we have launched in 2011, four has been open access."

So the second is, even if you publish in a closed access journal, you can still put the paper into the open access repository. We have 2000 such open access repositories. First is the discpline specific ones, like pubmed central, arxiv, the institutional open access repositories like OpenDOAR, Deposit Archives, and opendoar where you can see the full list of all open access repositories and you can see over the past six years over the growth of open access repositories.

These are infrastructure pieces for the open access community. It's great to see this growth in journals and repositories. The third type and enabling thing is managing your copyright. When you sign a copyright transfer form, make sure you know what's going on. You can go take a look at SHERP RoMe. You can attach an author note, like the one that SPARKfuns have. To preserve those rights so that you can put your work in an open repository even if it's published in a closed journal. There's also policy issues.

Open access policies at institutions. Again, we've seen these take off tremendously. We have over 130 mandates for open access at the institutional level. Even 50 at the funders.

These are some schools in the US that have open access policies. The research output must be openly available. Harvard MIT kansas. Big public schools require these. Liebral arts college like trinity and princeton have passed such policies. 

The NIH funds $30 billion in research each year. That's over half of what the government funds. About 80k papers every year are made openly available through the NIH policies. There are over 2M articles through this policy and the papers that are deposited. So, pubmed central sees over 500k users every single day. Even more staggering is that even 3/4s of that are outside the academy. I think this shows the demand for this knowledge. We should shorten it to 6 months, not just to the NIH but also the rest - th total $60B that we spend each year.

That's an introduction to the basics and where we stand right now. Why is open access important? Everybody in this room had this extact situation, you're reading abstracts, you try to get a paper, you click and you can't get access. You're not alone. There's a study in the UK that about 40% of researchers run into these barriers on a daily or weekly basis.

"The average academic library in the UK has access to just HALF of all journals." That's a pretty sad best case scenario. They are very wealthy. And they can only get 50%? Publishing has become a big business. It'si nsane. Springer and Elsevier are more profitable than Apple or Big Oil. This isn't a few hundred million, it's $6B each year. It's the size of the NFL. The commercial publishers have become dominant and the prices have gone up with their entrance from 1975 to 1995 we saw 200-300% of the journal prices above inflation. That's not just 200%- that's 200% above inflation. 7-10% increases per year.

These are just some average journal prices in discplines. These are just average journals. The average journal in chemistry is $4k for one subscription for one year. Here's a list of 15 discplines, and each journla is over $1k per subscription per year. So it's a very broken system. And open access fixes this very clearly.

Who benefits? I come from the student perspective. For student,s this is a game changer. We read open access for education and for up to date research-based education. Rather than just the subset that their university can afford. When students and professors can't access this, they can only teach what they have access to. This has a huge impact in medical care. Most doctors don't practice at a teaching institution.. they could spend $10M on subscriptions. So doctors at hospitals don't have access to up to date medical knowledge. Patients are locked out. If I was diagnosed with something serious, the first thing I would do is go research it and try to figure out what's the best traetment options.. most patients are not in academic institutions and they can't pay the subscription fees. Researchers stand to benefit in a huge way. There's a huge problem of duplicating research, I've had grad students talk to me, we psent a year on this research, before we started we made sure that we were donig novel researching, we submitted the paper.. and in the peer review process, a researcher who had access to a different subset of journals, had access to something else. And since they had access to the other paper, this is horrible because it could set back thiere career. 

There has been a strong increase in citation rates between 25-250% if it's open access. Researchers have strong reasons to make their work open access. If everyone is available to read it, then it's going to get cited more. This is also a game changer for the developing world. The access for North America is still horrendous and in the UK. De veloping countries don't have $10k/year to spend on a journal, so they are locked out of hug eamounts of scholarly research because they can't get access at all.

How students are changing the system. A little bit about my organization. We're the Right to Research Coalition. We were built around the Student Statement of the Right to Research. Access to research should be a student right. We had six members, all American in summer 2009. Today we are fully international, we have 40 undergrad groups representing 7 million students. Just to give you a feel, there's the American Medical Association, cfsfcee, we have the two largest student associations, like the Canadian Federation of Students. So what do we do?

We do advocacy. First, we do core advocacy at the institutional level to adopt policies about open access policies. We're starting to see studnets omre and more involved in advocacy. We have people in the Greece and the UK.

Also, we are at the federal level. There's the NAGPS and the federal open access policy. There was the National Association of Graduate Professionals, and they have taken up open access advoacy in a huge way. There are over 300 congressional offices on open access. This is the president of NAGPS giving an award to Mike Doyle in the house, in a previous congress. So what are the next things?

We've had, two organizations really start to take an interest in approaching professional societies. We started to work with the European Medical Student Association, and the European doctors and starting taht discussion. They are really excited to see it. We have other big discipline specific organizations and we are looking into approaching their professional societies. They can advocate this from the outside, but these students are the future of these societies and we can change them from the inside out.

Education is another half. So if we educate students today, it will go away in the long run. We have students now graduating and publishing papers, they are taking tthese lessons back to the national meetings and lots and lots of countries and educating their peers about open access.

We have lots of resources for our student members. That's what we do as HQ. With these resources, we have an open access flier, we're coming out with a student publishing guide to make sure your work is openly available. We're also doing a local advoacy guide. I want to share one thing. It's not public yet, but next week, we have members - Labenese medical association and it's going to be a member soon. They have translated our flier into Arabic. These people are doing great work, advocating to professional societies. You can't see them doing that.. but seeing people translating this into Arabic is great, and we will have 3 more translations and 3 more languages next week so stay tuned.

So next week is International Open Access Week. We have 2 webcasts about open access, one on monday at 8pm est. It will be a broader view on the state of open access. And Heather.. and then on Wednesday 9pm out here we will have John Wilbanks talking about open and its impact on research.

Thank you.
