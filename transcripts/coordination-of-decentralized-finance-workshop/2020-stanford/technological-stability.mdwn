Technological stability

Controversial thesis: the primary source of economic instability is unreasonable demands (from regulators, but really from the general public) for violating certain cryptocurrency tech design principles, like on sound money- privacy and confidentiality (like confidential transactions and confidential assets), monetary policy (like scarcity economics), identity vs anonymity, AML/KYC requirements, censorship, sanctions requirements and discrimination (e.g. denying money to certain parties), and issues of fungibility (like mixing and history-indistinguishability).

Financial stability goals- like avoiding global economic crashes- might be at odds with goals like producing sound money and privacy for everyone. What regulators need is something to show the general public that they are doing in response to economic crisis when the general public demands a response even if they are demanding irrational action.

In fact, what the general public should be most upset about is economic monetary policy stealing value away from their cash savings by way of inflation. Adding sanctions, removing fungibility, and requiring backdoors won't necessarily prevent economic catastrophe. Monitoring for market manipulation and monitoring of cryptocurrency exchanges might be a more relevant topic. But on the other hand, monetary policy is a kind of market manipulation, and for some reason that's allowed in some cases but not in others...

Source of technology stability issues- like mining, decentralization of mining, incentives for mining, fee market, fee market in a low-subsidy environment, and whether a fee market is able to keep the system operational.

How can we make the bitcoin protocol mature and more stable? Many developers don't think the current bitcoin protocol is mature enough. This is the reason why we hold the annual conferences like Scaling Bitcoin. Are there any concerns about how the current technology is mature?

I am not sure how a regulator can evaluate the security of a blockchain. Perhaps some standard or criteria to check if this blockchain. Unfortunately a checklist can't identify the stability or security of a protocol. There are some heuristics like how old are the technological components, and if there's something new then maybe that should raise some eyebrows.

I don't know how relevant the evaluation of the tech risk really is. Is it more important to measure decentralization? We evaluate activity and the securities laws. There's a threshold issue, and then it gets down into what are the activities and where does it fall into the overall framework. From an investor protection perspective, say we're talking about a security, then you can think about from an investor perspective or cap market perspective- is what we're talking about actually sound? If I'm thinking about a specific protocol, one of the things I'm going to think about is, does it do what it purports to do? What are the risks above and beyond above what it purportedly does? I think of things like blockchain reorgs of being one of the interesting aspects. From the perspective of investor transaction protection lense... reorgs don't look good. Do reorgs necessarily change order of transactions?

What would a developer do? Well, SEC has a whistleblower program. Then there's the SEC FinHub where you can walk us through the concern. The SEC setup FinHub. We're comprised of representatives from different offices in the SEC. We can dissemination information internally to people within the SEC. Financial Stability Oversight Council is a group comprised of OCC, CFTC, SEC, Treasury, FinCEN. We all get together and we talk about things to identify potential systemic risks so that we don't have a repeat of 2008. Our group, that's an example of where we interact with other regulators. There's also an interface with the general public so they can figure out what we do. FinHub does have p2p "office hours" and we fly around to hold the office hours to various cities. There's a webform where you can fill out your interest in a meeting, and attach some documents to make our lives easier, and then we can do a conference call, virtual meeting, or we can talk in DC or SF and then you sit down and talk with a regulator and explain whatever you want to talk about- typically people come and talk about their project and their tech. The value they derive from this is that we don't provide legal advice, but what we do is ask a bunch of questions.



Tech stability in the context of the traditional financial system: tech risk, malware, and bank system interference by (cyber)warfare.
