Introduction

Good morning. Glad to see many of you again. My name is Anton Yemelyanov. I am one of the organizers of this event. On behalf of Scaling Bitcoin planning committee, I would like to welcome everybody here to the third scaling event. We're holding this event here in Milan. Milan has a really vibrant community. It has been a real pleasure working with everyone here to create this event. The goal of Scaling as everybody knows is to get everyone together in a single place, all engineers and academic community so that we can discuss different scaling approaches and see how they can be applied to bitcoin. I would like to thank everybody who has submitted propsoals for presentations. We have received a lot of proposals and it has been a real challenge to pack them into this event. If we would have taken all of them, then this would have had to take 4-5 days. But I think it was a lot of interesting topics and I think we've done a good job of creating an interesting and strong program. So uh, without pfurther delay, I would like to introduce Fernando who is a professor-- bitcoin professor and here at Mont technical, and former blockchan and virtual currency in .. ...

So welcome everybody. ((applause))
