Sorry that we're running a little bit late. My name is Anton Yemelyanov. I am one of the organizers running this event. Welcome everybody. It's great to have a lot of familiar faces here. First of all, as you may know, we have ran over the last 2 days, Bitcoin Edge Dev++ where we have trained over 80 new developers that have joined our ecosystem. They have covered a number of topics including ECDSA and discreet log contracts. We're working as a community to enhance the development and scaling the development apacity of the industry. ... I think a lot of people have learned a lot. All of these sessions will be published online in 1-2 weeks time for the intenret community to absorb.
