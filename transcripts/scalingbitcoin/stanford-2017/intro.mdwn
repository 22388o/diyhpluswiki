Sorry that we're running a little bit late. My name is Anton Yemelyanov. I am one of the organizers running this event. Welcome everybody. It's great to have a lot of familiar faces here. First of all, as you may know, we have ran over the last 2 days, Bitcoin Edge Dev++ where we have trained over 80 new developers that have joined our ecosystem. They have covered a number of topics including ECDSA and discreet log contracts. We're working as a community to enhance the development and scaling the development apacity of the industry. ... I think a lot of people have learned a lot. All of these sessions will be published online in 1-2 weeks time for the intenret community to absorb.

I'd like to thank the planning committee for working together to put together this event. It has been a lot of hard work. We have a lot of interesting material coming up over the next 2 days.

So a little bit about the purpose of scalingbitcoin.org. I am not a public speaker myself, I am an engineer. I have a personal interest in an engineering approach towards the ecosystem towards exploring the technology that is developing and the new.. breakthrough elements of that.

A bit about the purpose of scalingbitcoin.org. What we want to do with this is ensure that bitcoin is aware of the most suitable fastest cryptography and has a process to develop the technical capacity within the development community to safely scale. We want to help continue to innovate and we want to encourage the conversation as to how innovation occurs especially between the layers of the bitcoin system. We have seen the emergence of layer 2 such as lightning network. We want as a community to see how that process takes place.
