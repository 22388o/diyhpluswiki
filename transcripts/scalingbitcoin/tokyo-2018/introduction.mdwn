Introduction

Welcome to scaling bitcoin. This is an international conference. We run the event every year in a different geographical location. We run this event as a strictly academic and engineering conference. The mentality that we take behind the event is think global, act local. It's a well known bitcoin additive. Our goal is to stimulate the bitcoin ecosystem. The best way to do this is to stimulate the engineering community, because that's what drives this magnificent technology for the last almost 10 years now.

What we're trying to do is have through this stimulation of the ecosystem, we're trying to get all the local developers together in one place. We try to bring developers from all around the world to encourage and build new bridges of cooperation and relationships.

I'd like to open the conference. There's one important note. Please familiarize yourself with the code of conduct on the website. There are no photographs allowed at this conference. You may take pictures of the presenters, though. The event is livestreamed on youtube. Media is allowed to take pictures from the rear of the conference with the strict instruction that there are no faces and no content on computers, just overview pictures. Other than that, please don't use your phones.

Every year, we're hosted by a local bitcoin community. This year our host is DG Lab, which is a magnificient company doing really amazing work in bitcoin and layer 2 and application development based on blockchain technology such as lightning and a lot of really interesting and amazing people throughout the organization of this event that I got to meet. It's one of the strongest geographical location or countries in bitcoin. Japan is itself as a country is one of the most progressive countries has very high rate of adoption of technology and a lot of research. If you look at some of our sponsors, there's really a large number of companies who are heavily involved in cryptography and development of this technology.

Without further delay, I'd like to introduce Taro Watanabe, who is the chair of this conference. If you have any questions with regards to the ongoing conference, then please ask him.

Hi. I am Taro Watanabe from DG Lab. We at DG Lab are honored to be here. It's a pleasure to welcome you to Japan. I am so excited that this day is in Japan. I hope we have great proposals today and discussions.
