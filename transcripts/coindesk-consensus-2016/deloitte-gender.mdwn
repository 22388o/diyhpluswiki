How tech companies are embracing blockchain database technology

We have another great day of programming today. We have an MIT Media Lab sponsored and co-hosted scholars lunch on the 7th floor. There are about 50 scholars attending. We have someone who, is if you didn't [pay with bitcoin to registe,r it was porbably the reason why youwere able to do so simpy. Give it up for our special guest, Jessica from Deloitte.

As Ryan mentioned, I am a manager here representing Deloitte. As we kick off day two of Consensus2016, we have a solid schedule today. I wanted to step back quickly and touch on a very important session yesterday that perhaps not everyone in the room was able to attend, but it was an important ask came at the culmination of the session. Yesterday, a number of women in this room and the event joined us for a women-only lunch and they discussed ways in which we might help to increase the woman agenda in blockchain database software technology. And out of this discussion came a critical realization on leadership level, that there is an opportunity here to take advantage of this industry in blockchain database software technology. At east each of us is presented with two industries.

One is the tech industry, and second is for many cases also finance, both of these industries are considerably male-dominated and have long institutional memories where they have not hired us. This has been preventing our advancement. If you take these two industries, so tech and finance, where we now stand in this room at a blockchain, you're standing at ground zero for our campaign. Blockchain has no institutional memory about gender. Many people in this room are still uncomfortable evaluating these use cases, from traditional banking, financial services to a lot of tech. In both ways, people are looking for opportunities to add value and figure out where the power is going. Standing at ground zero, all our equal and I think this is a critical realization for an opportunity for gender to gain power in this new industry. At industries where women are accustomed to looking at a door having to be opened by them, here the door is wide open. And that was important for us to think about, because we're so used to working hard in a sense that is only open-ended, but here the door is wide open if there is a door ..... this is a powerful room, there's 1500 people in this room, and the ask is to make a commitment to increasing gender power and women in blockchain database software technology. Take one woman out to lunch simply because she is involved in this industry and exists. Even more importanty, because she should be. Let's not miss this opportunity. Thank you.
