... the ramifications of making permanent changes to the genome and particularly changes that will be passed on to future generations, means it will be criticil to us to acknowledge these adverse perspectives. I look forward to our discussions and our reflections.

This meeting was organized by a committee, grown from the U.S., China, Britain and other nations. That group was coordinated by a few individuals in an amazing effort of leadership and guidance, and we owe her a lot for making this meeting possible. On behalf of the summit organizing committee, we wish to express deep appreciation for the president of the academy of Hong Kong, and their many colleagues in Hong Kong who have worked so hard to make this summit a reality. Let's give these individuals a token of our appreciation.

Let me thank you all for your attention on the program.
