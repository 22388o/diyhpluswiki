Introduction

Alright, please start taking your seats. Welcome to Bitcoin Commons. We're going to have a lot more people coming in. We're over 200. We probably have 130 here right now. Take your seats. We will do the national anthem. We'll do our national anthem after bitstein, Marty, and Pierre's talk. There will be a national anthem it's just coming later.

This space is Bitcoin Commons is for the Austin bitcoin community and the bitcoin community from all over the country to congregate. Marty records his podcasts here; we do programming workshops, hackathons, the idea is to proliferate bitcoin knowledge. We had to do this event because SXSW did not have any bitcoin events in any material way.

Matt ODell and Marty Bent are going to give a talk on censorship resistance. Matt and Marty for most of you guys- many of you might know about them, they are the co-host of Rabbit Hole re-cap. Matt is the founder of Citadel Dispaatch. Marty Bent is the host of Tales from the Crypt and board member at Cathedra publicly listed bitcoin mining company in Canada.
