That's why I was so excited when we got the proposal for cognitive computing. I am pleased and honored to introduce a person who has swayed between the interface between physics and computation tools to bring the field of neuroscience further, Prof. Dr. Henry Markram. He is co-director of the Brain Mind Institute, the Director of the Blue Brain Projector at EPFL, he is Director of the Center for Neuroscience Technology. Henry Markram has.. before joining EPFL... Weizmann Institute. He was also working for a couple of years as a .. fellow in the laboratory of .. at the Max Planck Institute. Among his many contributions to the field, one of his is the precise millisecond timing of pre and post synaptic potential to reveal an operating principle for spike timing dependency. These many fields that he has worked in has led to a series of awards such as the mumble mumble. He is now leading the Blue Brain Project at EPFL and IBM, and it is my great pleasure to introduce Henry Markram who will talk to us about the emergence of intelligence in the neocortical microcircuit. Please welcome..

Thank you very much for this honor. So, about 3 weeks ago we had this conference in Barcelona which was, to commemorate the 100 years since .. started drawing every neuron in the brain. He essentially did. He drew every type of neuron that we basically know now. The purpose of this conference was to reflect back on the last 100 years, but also look forward. If 100 years can happen, then maybe you can look further. What is going to happen in 100 years?

Well, two very interesting issues or topics of debate arose at this meeting. The first one was, many people said, what would we do as mankind to put inside a time capsule and send it out to space so that it would land on some alien planet and they would be able to understand who we are. Of course, you had all kinds of opinion, you had people saying let's send the genome, send it all over. So you are going to read the genome? I don't know. We don't know how to read it. We don't know how to construct who we are from the genome. It's a very important milestone, but are they going to understand who we are?

Other people said, since this was a meeting about the brain and the types of neurons, let's send the piles of the books about the different neurons. Okay, let's send them. We can't even look at all of these thousands of papers and reconstruct the brain and figure out how it works, so do we think they are going to be able to do it? Maybe if they are very advanced and they have already seen that type of biological design, they will say okay let's go. But maybe it's a silicon race and they can't figure out how to build us.

Other people said let's send DARPA's robot, and if you send their robot, are you really going to put your name on it and say this is us? So yes they would recognize that we were a very sophisticated race that could send DARPA probes, and they would know we could build robots. Would thta tell them about us?

What we think is that the one thing that would really demonstrate to an outsider that we understand the brain is that if we can send them the blueprints.. not just the biological blueprints, but the full biological processes that would look like us and interact and have all of the cognitive capabilities. Of course, that's a dream and challenge. That requires building a robot with a brain that is virtually a copy of the way that we are. So the first part of my talk was going to illustrate to you the very first small step towards not just building a neural circuit that is very clever, but to building accurate, a small part of the human brain.

The second issue which was very interesting, was what makes humans special? So you had all sorts of reactions. Some people said humans are not special. They are not special because in each environment of each animal, we all adapt as well as we can within that environment. But the overriding opinion was that we are special, and we're special because we can share knowledge for the purpose of understanding our own brain. It's difficult to find animals that can do that.

I think there is another reason for why we are far more special than that. And that is the imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge, said Einstein. I think the reason why imagination is so important is because it allows us to look inside the paradigm in which we are .. but not only to look inside the paradigm, but to say this is the foundation of axioms that we use to interpret the brain. It allows us to step outside that paradigm and let us say, whta if we actually interpret the brain from a completely different place?

So in the second part of my lecture, I am going to try to take you and illustrate you briefly the current paradigm that rules, from which we understand the brain. And then take you to the opposite paradigm. So let's begin with a .. the first... as we heard beautifully from Edelman, that the human brain really starts with the human neocortex. That is the emergence of man from mouse to man. It's a thousand fold expansion in the neocortex.

So much so that 80% of our brain is neocortex. That is what defines us. That is what allows us to interact, predict, analyze, it's the neocortex. In the neocortex, there .. the neocortex is essentially composed of small little microchips or columns, known as columns. There are about a million of these columns in the human brain. They are each about 0.5 mm in diameter. One can debate forever what a column is. It's the minimum set of neurons that creates a society for neurons. Neurons are not islands. They need a group around them. The minimum set of neurons around them turns out to be approximately the size of the column. In the rat it is about 10,000 neurons and in the human it is about 100,000 neurons.

I nevolution these columsn were added, until the brain folded upon itself. That is why the brain is so convoluted. The secret to the neocortex is to understand these little columns. The goal of my lab has been to go inside these little columns and try to reverse engineer how they are built with as much detail as we have technology allows us to do.

So just to give you an idea of what that looks like, this is a technique that we devleoped at that time called multi-neuron patch clamp. You put a slice of brain under a microscope, you use infrared to visualize the brain while it is alive, you use a glass pipette to approach the neuron and clearing away by positive pressure, and then you clamp on you suck on to the membrane, you blow a little hole and then you can inject dyes or record electrical behavior. You can see the morphology with dies. You can send little messages. This is an extremely powerful technique because it gave us the tools to systematically start reverse engineering the microcircuits.

So over the years we have developed this to the most extreme art that is possible right now. This is a 12 patch setup. We can't get more manipulators in there. We need to have very fine sub-micron precision or control of these manipulators so that we can choose which cells. But this has allowed us to rapidly increase the rate at which we get the data and work out how the circuits are built. We inject a dye into these, we use a confocal laser scanning microscope and we can see the full structure of the cells.

So the first thing that you hit upon is you re-discover Cathal's inspiration that he must have had when he looked under the microscope. He called them the butterflies of the cerebral cortex. You have a whole spectrum of different types of cells, just like in the Amazon forest with a whole spectrum of trees. This is a daunting variety of trees. Wheen you go to the computational people and show them this, they are completely flabbergasted. How are we going to understand the brain with so many types of neurons?

They do cluster and group into certain classes. There are nine types of neurons. In the previous lecture, there are inhibitory cells. There are also 9 or 10 types of excitatory cells located in different layers. There is a certain order.
