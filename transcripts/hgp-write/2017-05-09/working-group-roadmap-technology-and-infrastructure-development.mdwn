Working group roadmap: Technology and infrastructure development

Jeffery A. Schloss

Let's try to get started. We have until 2 pm. That should be plenty of time to solve all the problems.

Jeff Schloss. No longer working at NIH since December.

What to get out of the working group?

What are the current bottolenecks and what would make the biggest difference if we could change those if we could improve? What are the key bottlenecks? Many different ways to achieve some things, sometimes only a single critical path. Which technologies need improvement?

I am coming from a model where at NIH we had some money to decide to devote to solving that set of problems. That's not the case here for GP-write; we don't yet have the money, but what could we do with that?

Up to sequencer verification? Up to delivery?  What about other technology if you had working DNA synthesis? Are we missing importnat scope and discussion?

"So what"- why make DNA? Many demonstration projects will happen.

Working group-- should we pick demonstrations and say what are the key barriers? Get some test beds and gives a focal point into the trnasformation issue, depending on organism or application.

$1/genome target goal

Would be nice if synthesis would work entirely no matter what sequence is requested.

Data storage -- oligo pool method, not necessarily base-by-base. But that is due to current technological limitations in DNA synthesis.

Fairly clear endpoint-- synthesize 3B bp of human genome. We can do that with current tech. We need next-gen tech for design and synthesis to get over the line in a reasonable timeline at a reasonable price point.

Is the goal to be able to synthesize a human genome? Being able to write any large genome is interesting.

Human genome project singular focus. Let's focus on the obvious thing, the original vision of this, writing the human genome. There will be stepping stones, model systems.

yeast is 12M bp, factor of 4 difference.. We could bruteforce. 

HGP spent $3B on sequencing. Should we do it bruteforce for writing? Is that okay? Or should we focus on next generation technology?

"Human" just gets people excited. It's the size that matters. "Moonshot". 

Iteration time is also important. Short iterative time. Turnaround time of 10-20 kb time. Have to move away from chemistry, to enzymatic approaches.

How do write a human genome, or any genome at that scale, or bgiger things? How do we do this fast, accurate and cheap?

Only craig venter has made a synthetic bacterial genome from scratch. That was 7 years ago.

Centralized repoistory for the intermediate pieces... Reagents, DNA molecules, constructs. Organized repository with tracking, metadata, physical repository. Conditionings for joining consortium, includes sharing xyz materials? Has that been decided?

yeast to store megabase chromosomes, and then split up human chromosomes, 48 yeast clones..

What is a critical step that needs at least an order of magnitude improvement in one of its aspects?

* 1000x cost reduction in DNA synthesis technology (machine development)
* 1000x reduction in genome synthesis cost
* 10x longer oligos that are error-free
* 1000mers
* DNA assembly is a huge problem
* assembly
* error-free large gene synthesis, more than 10kb
* representation of standards - for database storage
* multiplexing and parallelization of synthesis
* enzymatic synthesis
* cell delivery mechanisms, host can deal with up to 10 Mb right now, cell fusions can do this but where do you put it when you synthesize it? miniprep a chromosome nope. 500kb electroporation
* large construct amplification technology
* host organism or host cell, is it human, do you have to deconstruct a human cell or come up with a platform
* break the genome down into smaller chunks, swap in to build the yeast chromsome, etc...
* what is the minimum human genome
* scifi book character that was intron-free, Altered Carbon
* microfluidics
* foundry on a chip
* large dna transfer into cells
* universal chromsome that can be added into any cell simply, like C24 technology, like on-off switch, get rid of it when you don't need it; or whole library that you could activate
* better phosphoramidite chemistry
* better enzymatic DNA synthesis
* better inkjet arrayers
* single molecule 10 kb synthesis, get around repetitive sequence problems
* single molecule techniques

# Next steps?

* DNA synthesis survey whitepaper/review
* call for proposals to meet certain goals
* call for pilot projects meeting certain DNA synthesis goals
* survey the community for speculative DNA synthesis technology for long-term development projects
* GP-write machine shop to develop custom DNA synthesis technology?
