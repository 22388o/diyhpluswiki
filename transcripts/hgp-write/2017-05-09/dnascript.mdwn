We want to switch from a chemical catalyst to a polymerase. It's super efficient. We want to change the paradigm of chemical catalyst synthesis of DNA and use enzymes. You can see from the structure of this polymerase, ... .. incoming nucleotide incorporation. 

Template free DNA polymerase, ... first some dee penzyme engineering. Unique and simple protection. We use this polymerase with modified nucleotides that were designed to tightly control the synthesis process. Modification and very simple, ... so far, we have reached very ... purity, speed and simplicity of the process. I can report in front of you that de novo synthesis of DNA using enzyme is a reality and is already ... So it's an opportunity for a new... with a very efficient technology, we think we can accelerate new...

# Q&A

Q: What is the length of DNA you can make?

A: I can't expose this information.
