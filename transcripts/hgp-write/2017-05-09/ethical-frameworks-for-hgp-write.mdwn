Ethical frameworks for hgp-write

I have an important matter that we need to resolve today. Is the W in GP-write, is it capitalized or not? Seems like the answer is no.

I teach medical ethics and history of science. I had a kind of a historical perspective I wanted to bring. We had the March for Science a couple of weeks ago. I asked myself, since I teach history of science, could this have happened a couple of years ago? I think 50 years ago it would have been unthinkable. If you said science to an American 50 years ago, they would have said the space program. My first search result looking this up was a Soviet stamp from 1957... the French had a postage stamp the same year.

We were thinking about driverless cars in Popular Science, but they were on rails. We were also thinking about Casia and the moons. Ten years later, in 1977, where was science according to google? There was a confusing period-- which direction. I do this once in a while.

What's happened in the last 50 years that we need to pay attention to in a project like gp-write? Conservative trust in science has plummetted since 1974, this only goes up to 2010 but no doubt these lines have continued. A project like gp-write needs to pay attention to this I am not telling you anything you don't know.

I was not at the first meeting, but there was a lot of ethics at the first meeting. There's a lot of scientific efforts that-- there's a lot that have not gained the trust of the public. We talk about this in my classes. A lot of it is not about science, but rather mistrust in scientists. A lot of people have never seen so many scientists in one place, except at the march.

GP-write publication had a good summary. I think the science article was pretty good. Thinking about a better future-- I think a lot of people can get behind this, I think this is a good start. I do have a couple of suggestions. These are questions raised by some of the critics from a year and half ago. I think GP-write should consider some of these or perhaps in public engagement or ethics.

What is a human genome? There are disagreements among scientists about whether we have a human genome. The published reference genome has 100s of gaps, there are several individuals as George just said, we have not published a single human genome without gaps, there's a reasonable question there. What are the benefits of synthesizing a human genome? Should the priority be given to less controversial genomes first? Let's not rush it. The cell lines only principle is a good concept, it should be re-affirmed by a panel for GP-write.

Does this policy only to human or are we going to make synthetic genomes for synthetic mmamals?

No artificial deadlines: let's do it naturally, let's see what unfolds over the next few years.

Bioterrorism is not something we talk about in a project like this. I think it's important. I read this guy's book, Regenesis, by George, and that's where he said that. I take that seriously. There are dual use research concern. Biosafety as bioethics. We do have to think abou this going forward. DURC-- dual use research concern. This tends to be top-down-- the way that the DURC--... that's not the way that a project like GP-write should go. We need a bottom-up approach, like how the Europeans and in particular the Germans do. I know this will freakout the scientists that are worried about it undermining the progress of science. The public will demand that there be a great consideration at each step of the way in a project like this.

The gp-write panels should specify a bottom-up policy.

There needs to be a regulator review maybe one of the first things to do for the project is to look at the landscape like the weapons conventions and so on, to see what's missed and what's the downstream risks, and how to make positive contributions to fill in some of the blanks. There are lots of blanks in the field such as neuroscience.

We need to think about new ways of doing public engagement. It's annoying, it takes time away from the science. It's just something we have to do. We have to do it in the next year, for the aniverssary of Frankenstein perhaps.. journalists might pick up on this, and it's the 200th anniversary of Frankenstein.
