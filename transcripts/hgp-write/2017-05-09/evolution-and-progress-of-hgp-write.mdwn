# What is gp-write?

I am going to start simple. We have a diverse crowd here. We have some scientists that want to know about DNA sequences; we have some reporters that might not want that kind of fine-grained discussion. So let's start big picture. As we heard from Nancy, it's a project to support technology development in genome writing. It could also be described as genome design and synthesis, and then an evaluation of the impact of genome design changes.

This uote here is paraphrasing what we wrote in our whitepaper. We want to reduce the cost of designing, synthesizing, assembling and testing genomes in cells by 1000 fold over the next 10 years. It's an aggressive goal. Based on what we saw with the human genome project, the reading project if you will, we think we can do this. We think that such technology improvements will really revolutionize ohw we as scientists learn about the world and then how we use that information to engineer.

# GP-write vs GP-read

Nancy allude3d to the development of a roadmap for GP-write. I want to talk a little bit about that. GP-write vs GP-read first. So, GP-read is what we now refer to as the human genome project, the sequencing project of the human genome which was of course expanded to include many model organism genomes like the fruit fly and mouse etc. And so, GP-write is the next phase. It's interesting to contemplate the difference between reading and writing. You kind of know when you're done reading, you finished the book, maybe there are some complexities as to interpretation, but reading is really well suited to a purely scientific endeavor because it's really clear when you have finished decoding.

On the other hand, writing has an element of creativity to it, it has an artistic side if you will; when are you finished? You could write one book, or a thousand books. It's fundamentally different from reading, and this excites me and others.

# GP-write vs HGP-write

What about gp-write versus HGP-write? Last year the meeting was titled hgp-write. As you will see in a moment, we have defined GP-write as the overarhing effort to develop genome writing technologies. We are all passionately interested in our genomes, and the notion that we could write a human genome is simultaneously thrilling to some and not so thrilling to others. And so we recognize that this is going to take a lot of discussion from a lot of stakeholders so we defined HGP-write as an initiative within GP-write that perhaps we will have to move more slowly on as we engage these stakeholders. This has dominated our thinking about the large-scale roadmap.

A very important component of this that has been lost in a lot of the writing is that HGP-write we will do in cells only, not producing organisms.

# Roadmap

The first 5 years has a heavy technology development focus and to develop pilot projects that might have immediate benefit to society. You will hear more about that in a moment. During this time period, we want an intense debate about the hgp-write component and engage a diverse group of stakeholders.

As a genome designer, I am interested in identifying what are the interesting designs for hgp-write. Are there more worthy goals?

After that, we can pursue highly worthy genome projects while continuing to develop technologies. We need that price drop.

# Name change

Why did we change the name? Well, we listened to a lot of you a year ago, and we thought that combining the two components was really helpful to the future of the project. Many journalists bring the same question back to me for hgp-write in particular, why are you doing this?

I'll offer two kinds of answers.

I want to know the rules that make a genome tick. I want to learn about it. This was paraphrasized from a quote allegedly found on Richard Feynman's blackboard, "What I cannot create I cannot understand" and this has become a kind of manifesto for our field. What we learn about this is the 3d structure of the synthetic chromosomes in the synthetic yeast cells; on the right here you see maps of chromosomes taking trajectories through the nucleus of the cell. This was done using a technique known as HiC. This was one such synthetic chromosome, the fifth chromosome, which you will hear later. This is the native version; and this is what happens when you make a synthetic version with thousands of changes; we removed repetitive DNA, all the tRNA genes, and yet there's only a minimal impact of the trajectory  and the overall structure.

Secondly, we want to do good things- not bad things. Why? Well, I thought I would go biblical on you. There's the 10 plagues from Exodus- here they are, frogs, blight, water, etc. Today, we have environmental destruction, we have invasive species, we have emerging pathogens, we have food security problems, and we have climate change. All of these things have potential biological solutions that GP-write we think would be an integral part of.

# History of writing

Mesopotamia, egypt 3000 BC. It goes way back. George will tell you that he has encoded an entire movie in DNA, every pixel. But actually on this when we talk about DNA writing in cells, we're kind of in this Gutenberg phase... we can write millions of letters of DNA, but that's about it. We're at the very beginning. In fact, the history of DNA writing in cells started around 1976, with transfer RNA gene synthesis. It has expanded extensively, there are viruses in 2002, Venter mycoplasma in 2010, and this year the synthetic yeast genome, and maybe humans in the near future.

# DNA writing recent activity

Our Sc2.0 project- which you will hear a lot about- has generated a lot of excitement. We have participants here from Australia and China and many other places. We have new funding of various types which George will go into in more depth. This is an international project.

# Dark matter project

We are launching a dark matter project. In case you don't know what that is, you can look it up on Amazon, Nessa Carey Junk DNA.
