# Introduction

Hi everyone. For this talk, I don't have slides. I am feeling a bit naked without slides. Let's try anyway. I want to share some of the ideas I've been working on. In about two weeks, I am speaking with the Fidelity steering committee in Boston. I've been thinking about what I want to say and what I think is important. One of the things that has always fascinated me is, what is the meaning of bitcoin in the grand scheme of things? All these technologies? Is it a catalyst for something? Is it an isolated phenomenon? As an economic analyst, you look at trends, you try to extrapolate, you follow smart people with integrity, you try to get rid of noise that way and listen to their signal. Even then, you still have a million possibilities about where things go, and you might be overlooking thresholds, where things are going, or different catalysts.

# History

For me, the solution to this is to try to study history. Are there things that have happened in the past and we can see an analogy with what's happening today? It doesn't mean that history is repeating, but we might be able to lower the field of probabilities and better identify connections because otherwise we're listening to the contemporaries processing the same exact information.

# Historical comparisons

In 2014, I did a piece about how bitcoin is a new petroleum. I made an analogy with the whaling industry which was then decimated with the emergence of petroleum as a global commodity and energy source. I did work on comparing the 2016-2017 crypto craze with the dot com boom, which is kind of obvious but there's some nuances that are interesting. I have also compared cryptocurrencies to the domain name market where I argued that bitcoin is the dot com and its value is therefore a lot more valuable than the other domain names. Yahoo and Google are also analogies for Bitcoin and Ethereum. I've done that. All those analogies to me, fell short of what I think is potentially the magnitude of what we're talking about. Not that bitcoin is of such magnitude, but that it is potentially a catalyst and much greater transition in which we are in society. I was especially intrigued when I started to study the 16th century protestant reformation, which was a turbulent period where the catholic church lost a lot of influence, the balance of power in europe really changed, and then maritime exploration really flourished.

# Conditions enabling reformation

Looking at that period, there were three conditions that were met that enabled the reformation to occur. There were technological challenges with travel, and there was a major shift in a short amount of time. I think the first thing was technological revolution. The 16th century saw the printing press, which lowered the cost of a book from a year's wage to the cost of a chicken. That's how low it went in one century; that allowed for the publication of many more ideas. Double entry bookkeeping came to the forefront in that era, which allowed businesses to expand internationally and have multiple branches with their books still in order. This in turn meant that shareholders could more easily demand accountability, and division of labor was advanced that way. In addition, there was the compass, the hour glass, and others, which were perfected in the 16th century. This meant you could go with your boat into uncharted territory and still make it back to the same port, even if you didn't know where you would be going. If you logged it the right way, you could find your way back. Even in 2000s, there was the commoditization of data storage, social media, cryptography, p2p networks, email, all of these when bundled together they empower individuals to bootstrap startups and really disrupt ossified systems and to do it very differently.

As a consequence of that technological revolution, you get wealth that is built up. The merchant class benefited from international trade in the 16th century, including from specialized crafts. Today, it is probably the technologists and the Silicon Valley millionaires and today we are also talking about cryptocurrency wealth that is being generated. The balance of power is still in place, but the wealth has a different distribution and that creates a tension. I think that's what we're talking about today. Right now bitcoin is worth $150 billion, but make it 2-3 trillion dollars, all of the sudden that really starts to shift things. We recnetly have seen that GE might be going broke; all these institutions that we thought would last forever are going by the wayside.

# Tension

So the tension is building up. In the 16th century, the tension was revelling up against the Catholic Church. The thing to revel against is a monopolostic service provider. So you see that there should be something else possible, but you have been forced to use this service. You see they are rent seeking, and hence basically exploiting you. In the 16th century, they were selling forgiveness for sins. They needed to fund the cathedral in rome and they started to pre-sell indulgances for future sins, even theft or not. So you could buy an indulgence before going to rob a bank or something. Today, there's QE and money printing which Michael was talking about-- regular banks have access to the money first, so that means the man in the street or the regular people are being taxed even more by this monopolistic service provider. So what are they offering? It's basically financial salvation, like your pension or your insurance. Everything is settled in this fiat currency, and that means you always get taxed as long as you are involved in that system.

What is the spark that might set off the refomration? In 1511, there was a Dutch philosopher that wrote "priase of folly" which was a satire of the catholic church. There was also the theses by Martin Luthor later, criticizng the indulgences. In the 2000s, there was the crash and the 99% movement, and then bitcoin. In bitcoin, the first block had a phrase that was clearly a criticism of QE.

# Battle cries

If there is a conflict, what were the battle cries? In the 16th century, it was something about "you don't need a priest to give you access to heaven", that you don't need a third party to grant you permission to go to heaven. The other phrase said, you could study scripture in the bible even in your own language, you don't need a priest to interpret it for you from latin. Today we have something similar, people call them memes. In bitcoin, "truth in math and numbers" which basically means we don't have to trust some committee with men with beards to decide on the financial policy. Instead, we can look at the code and see it for ourselves. "Don't trust, verify" means you don't need to trust a third-party. "Not your keys, not your bitcoin"- again, you don't need to use a bank, you can be in charge yourslef.

# Defense mechanisms

When we're talking about a conflict that definitely happened in the 16th century, and might happen today although hopefully not as violent, what I find interesting is to look at --- offensive warfare, like armies or police, but perhaps today you would be talking about data gathering. What I find more interesting is looking at the defensive side: what were people using to defend themselves to help start bypassing the church? In the 16th century, Spain got really upset about what was happening in The Netherlands and they were printing pamphlets and bibles and preaching new things in churches. One of the defenses was pseudonymous pamphlets so that you could publish ideas without being prosecuted yourself. Another defense mechanism was water, very often used, one of the reasons why Amsterdam was never invaded was because the Rhyme river runs between and it is costly to cross that river with a lot of troops, and the lowlands are named like that for a reason. What they would do to defend themselves is open the dams and let the lands flood, and then the soldiers would be stuck in a swamp. Water was a great means of defense. You could also flee over the ocean, to go to the new world or England, and then armies can't as easily track you down.

What defenses could we talk about for the modern era? I don't know if it is the equivalent of water, but a powerful technology is encryption. The use of multisignature wallets, timelocks, vaults and encryption, is a way to protect your identity, a way to protect information about you, a way to protect your financial means especially in bitcoin. This can be very powerful. Also, taking your activities off-shore, which we have seen in the bitcoin space. Most of the bitcoin volume is generated by off-shore exchanges. Also, pseudonymity-- we still don't know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, and he's probably still a free man thanks to using a pseudonym. Also, the equivalent for pamphlets is social media, for quick propagation of ideas. Also, I think bitcoin itself is a defensive means to establish your autonomy and your choice to bypass whatever it is that you want to bypass.

# Investment

Since this is a gathering for investors, what's the investment angle on this? What's the pathway to economic prosperity if we are in a reformation period? In the 16th century, to maintain or build your wealth, you had to be in the right territory. You had to be in Amsterdam, not Spain, where ideas could flow freely and money would flow freely as well, and where there was religious tolerance. The Netherlands became basically New York City and it was able to become so incredibly prosperous as a trading hub due to the religious tolerance. Financial investments backthen, you would have sophisticated contracts like annuities. There was a full reserve gold bank in Amsterdam where you could store your gold, and a lot of the wealth of Europe was stored there. There were also maritime missions you could invest in, and make profit that way. The ultimate thing was to sail to the new world and stake your claim. If you are going to invest in this new world, I would suggest also considering to some extent to use bitcoin as a financial benchmark as a way to measure the performance of your investments in this space.

# Open questions

What is the equivalent of a city that is doing extremely well today, but might be threatened because they are pushing the envelope too far? Is it going to be Hong Kong, who will be folded back into the fiat empire? Or where is Amsterdam, where is the place that we should all be? Is it even a physical place?

What are the things that are going to build on top of this? Going to the new world wasn't enough; you had to build something there. If you go into bitcoin, then what are you going to do? What activities do you want to invest in, or what do you want to do?

The road ahead, in my opinion, is that altcoins are not that interesting because I think the big picture is about censorship resistance so you need a technology that converts electricity into financial reliability. We don't need a million ways to do that; if we have one mechanism that works, it is going to strengthen over time just from network effects.

Centralized custody is not that interesting, since there's collaborative custody which is more robust and more insured against political risk. I think bitcoin will become a financial standard and a benchmark. Bitcoin lending I think is going to be huge, it's already growing, but I think lending markets are really going to explode especially if in the traditional markets that interest rates are raising. It might be an alternative way to fund companies, too. Bitcoin derivatives are important for any bitcoin company, because they need to hedge against volatility. I am extremely bullish on bitcoin derivatives.

Longer-term, I think bitcoin has a big role to play in insurance because it's the ultimate reserve asset and to store wealth for a long time and cross generations. I think there's very interesting applications there.

Why is bitcoin different? I would say, like I said earlier, it's just a technology to convert electricity into financial reliability. Just like the internet, we needed something to put information on the wire and that was TCP/IP. By comparison, bitcoin puts wealth in your pocket and does it well. I don't think we need 100 coins, but I think we will have them, and the bitcoin dominance will be 80-90% of the market.

Thank you.
