I'll start. Andrew, oragnizations. I guess. People sort of join the network,
pledged to sort of keep things secret, or is it open to everyone else, or open
to within the organization, or comment on it? For me, everything is completely
transparent, we're not going to patent or license it, I don't think there's
any value in cancer therapeutics with N=1. I would rather sell drinks to make
a profit. I am not saying that's a bad thing.. network where people join
together and sort of be pledged about being open.. and then people stealing
ideas.. just wondering about people stealing. In contrast, SAGE does a model
that dose both. If people are williing to shhare theeir data, that's great,
and then people can share, annd if ppeople want privaccy, that's how we
separaate that.. And ouurs is yet another version of thaat, we arre
respeeeectful of many different ways that people do things, is to college, and
for both academic and commercila collaborators, there is a period up to a year
after their project completels with is, for things to be kept private, but
then we insist that it goes into the public domain, and we have started msot
of our collaboration discussions, if you can't agree to everything going into
the public domain, because we don't have time to work with you. We have yet to
have a commercial partner walk away, and it is often the academics who are the
most nervous, but with time perhaps they will become quite cooperative. This
new drug dev paradigm with one person one treatment, the industry would love
to do it, their system doesn't support it, the FDA doesn't support it, part of
it is to do this through grassroots. There are lots of people who make drugs,
there are lots of people who do drug .. the people who do DIY drug makers,
they arenot the Pfizers of the world, it's hard to deliver them in a regulated
way, in an approved way, this whole process, we want to give it to Pharma, we
don't want to theraten their business. We are each individuals, that's what
the change. One other comment about that, the pharma industry had the Bestou
Alliance, drug discovery and informatics, for pre-competitive space, for what
Sage mentioned, it's not necessarily academic-versus-industry, it's not
neglected-versus-commercial, we work on .. because of the Gates foundation..
humanitarian, there might be information before you validate an experiment, it
could be a temporal thing, and it's not always who's going to share what when,
there's a history back to the history of the scientific publication industry.
I have worked with the Gates foundation earlier, there are academic ecosystems
where it's not the researcher who is resistant, it's the grant office, or
perhaps whoever is evaluating the researcher, who is resistant. It is holding
us back in terms of the rate ... different questions, okay, I am at the center
for emerging diseases.
