I am also going to suggest that open science faces a pair of problems called
scylla and charybdis. I am going to introduce the health impact fund proposal,
and suggest how it could complement biomedical research and I am going to
suggest possible directions for research.

First of all, what are the problems in a really long list of problems in
pharmaceutical markets? The first one is that our paradigm for research is
deeply inefficient. We're missing a lot of great opportunities because of the
system that we have. So there's secrecy in research and this secrecy in
research is created ass a sort of by product of the patent system. This kind
of secrecy leads to a lot of duplication, excessive costs, and fewer promising
new clinical products. At the same time, because information isn't shared, you
end up with fewer collaborative, less collaborative work and fewer good
outcomes for people. The research paradigm also directs research into the
product areas that are going to be profitable, not those that will have the
highest health impact. Companies will spend a lot of money working on drugs
for rich people and ignore the needs of the poor.

It's also true that the paradigm for pricing is deeply inefficient. Since
companies are awarded for developing therapies by the grant of the patent- the
idea of the patent is that you get to exclude others from the use of
innovation, then you keep prices high, and then this results in massive
underuse of new drugs, to the detriment of poor people. Those are what I think
are the key problems.

An important open science proposal is Allen Edwards and others in the
structural genomics consortium. So uh, the new model that Aled Edwards
proposed, in combination wwith government- deeeeevelop new drug targets in a
consortium, um, with all research output to be open access. I think I don't
need to say why that has benefits in terms of the science. It's pretty clear
that the structural genomcis consortium using this model has had considerable
success. Aled is proposing a push further forward than the SGC has gone so
far. He's really thinking of pushing the consortium out into first and second
stage clinical trials so that yuo have products being developed to a proof of
concept stage. He's proposing a pre-competitive scientific experiment whose
results would be available to all, and enable development at the next stage
into a commercialized product.

So now we return to Scylla and CHarybdis. For those of you who have forgotten
what was in the Odyssey; according to Homer, Odyssus had to steer his boat
between two horrible monsters named Scylla and Charybdis, and Scylla was a
horrible monster with six long necks with grisly heads. Charybdis had a face
that was all mouth, she would suck in water and vomit it out every few hours.
So, I wanted to get a picture, but I couldn't find one. I think open science
has to deal with its own Scylla and Charybdis in the pharmaceutical markets.

Here's the scylla. You go through with this consortium, you develop a product
to the proof of concept phase. But the product becomes unpatentable. And so
companies looking at this are going to say "how am I going to make money on
this when I don't have patent protection?" And they decide to leave the
product, not spend enormous money on clinical trials, required to bring it
into the market with FDA approval, and this is not a good outcome in the sense
that you've developed a product up to the proof of concept phase, but you have
got nothing out of it. This is the worst possible outcome. This would not be
an attractive result.

Suppose on the other hand that you are successful, in the sense that you get
the proof of concept phase, and then some company is able to get exclusivity.
This doesn't look good either (this is Charybdis). The final product is
protected by patents, but then sold at high prices. This doesn't really go at
the open science concept, which you started development with. You end up
excluding many poor patients from the use of the product.

A brief word on clinical trails- clinical trials are really essential to
product approval. Stage three trials are expensive. Some people claim that the
typical cost for a phase three trial which brings a product to market
approval, the average cost is $80M. That's the figure I hear. They are risky.
There's a reasonable probability that even if they are successful, you might
not get an approved product at the end. And it's not an organized open science
framework. Governments could fund it, but historically that hasn't happened.

Here's where I think the health impact fund fits with open science. I am going
to switch tracks for just a minute and introduce the idea. THe idea of the
Health Impact Fund is that each year there is a fixed sum for registered
pharmaceutical innovations. Innovators could choose whether to register their
product with the Health Impact Fund. If they decide not to, they have the
usual options. If they do, they are obliged to sell the product at a low
price, or else to license it openly, and then they would be compensated for
this through rewards paid by the health impact fund. The key idea is these
rewards in the fund.

How would the rewards be set? There would be a fixed reward pool each year.
Each participating firm would obtain a share of the reward pool in each 10
years, following the introduction of the product, and each product's share
would be equal of the reward funds, its share of the total qualities of all
participating products. Companies generating a lot of health impact would have
a big share of the reward pool. Measuring the health impact would be QALY-
quality adjusted life years. You would be looking back each year and look at
how the product has been used, to figure out its health impact, and therefore
its share of the reward pool.

Innovators might like this idea because you choose products to opt into this
thing that high expected health benefits, but low expected profitability under
the usual approach. Especially products that are mainly used by relatively
poor patients who can't normally afford to pay very much money. Another class
of firms that might want to register their products are in cases where you had
a product developed under a public-private partnership that would require a
low pricing, or if the firm otherwise was reluctant to charge high price.

If the product lacks effective patent protection; if you don't have good
patent protection, how are you going to make money? Well, Health Impact Fund
has a way to make money. They have a way to reward the product moving through
market approval. Let me tell you a little bit about health impact assessment.
If you are going to assess health impact, you want to use all available
information, you have to engage in lots of inference, as to the benefits
created by a particular drug, the kind of information that would be available-
like data from clinical trials, and then you have to add to this, like data
from pragmatic trials, like how is it used in practice? Sampling of use in the
product in different environments, survey data on demographics and clinical
characteristics. You put all of thsi stuff together to assess the health
impact of the product.

We thinkt hat the hhealth iimpactt fundd can be finaaced by governmennts,
because thhey have the fiinanciial abbility to make the coommiitmments. IIf
this iis going to work, it has to be in the billions of dollars. Countries can
contribute proportionality to their income. It's important to note that this
isn't just a huugge new resouurce ccost, sincee the cooost of rewarrds woould
bee at leeast partially compensated by savings in the low prices on the drugs
that were registered. On the one hand you would be paying out for rewards, but
they would be leading to low priced drugs that you wouldn't have to spend lots
of money on.

An important feature of this is that the rate of rewards is self-adjusting.
Firms know that the rewards that they are going to get are going to be
reasonable, since the reward rate going to be too low means that other firms
aren't going to enter. At the same time, taax payers knnnow that the
rewwwwardss aren'tttt going to be too high, because then lots of other firms
will enter.

Let me zip through to the oopen science bit. In a way then, the health impact
fund offers firms a mechanism to be rewarded for developing products, through
to approval, and then ensuring that the products are effectively developed and
distributed. The products don't have to depend on patent status. The firms
that finance this through the appppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppprooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooval proccesssss, they get rewards; based on sales on all other firms that
are selling that product, not just their own sales.

To suggest wherre we aaare going next- we are working on a pilot, where we
have a particular drug sold under these terms in a particularr country. Let me
just metnion a couple of other things. First, the product, this proposal
doesn't just stem from me. Jaimmmie especially was instrumental in thinking
about this general idea. And there have been many other people who have worked
on this idea over time. We've been working on developing this proposal, by the
way I should say that Jamie Lovett is going to speak next, he doesn't agree
with everything in this proposal, but a lot of the underlying ideas are his,
so there. We've been in talks with governments and industry and many others.

Okay, I guess I'll close there, and hopefully we'll have some time for
discussion. Thank you.
