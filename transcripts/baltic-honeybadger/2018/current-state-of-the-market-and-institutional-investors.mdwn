Bitcoin Association Guy (BAG)

BAG: I'm here with Bruce Fenton and Tone Vays. Bruce is also host of the Satoshi Roundtable and a long-term investor. Tone Vays is a derivatives trader and content creator. We're going to be talking about Wall Street. I believe you're both based in NY? How was the last 12 months?

TV: I own an apartment there, but I think I spent 9 months a year everywhere else. Bruce, I didn't know you were in NY. I don't know too many bitcoiners in NY. It's amazing how you don't do much with bitcoin in the place you live, but you do a lot everywhere else.

BF: I'm in New Hampshire actually. I used to live in NY. I'm on the board of a company there. I'm there pretty often. I grew up on Wall Street and kept in contact with my own colleagues and friends theres.

BAG: Did they all call you up and get urgent advice?

BF: Sometimes. It's been years now. They thought I went crazy when I talked about bitcoin with them 5-6 years ago. Then they got interested in. They are completely focused on the products. They don't care much about some of the bigger picture cycle issues. There's definitely a lot of interest; there's a huge lack of understanding by a lot of people on Wall Stree.t

BAG: What stage are they at? Are they thinking about it? Are they buying bitcoin?

...

TV: That's all currency is, it's confidence.

BAG: Bruce, do you think people on Wall Street can be trusted with bitcoin?

BF: In this space, there's a lot of conflict. I try to get along with everyone. I like and respect people on every side of this. If you recognize that everyone in the world is motivated by self-interest, then you don't trust anyone no matter how much you like them because they might be compromised. I don't trust anybody, though, including anyone on Wall Street.

BAG: A lot of money is going into the industry. Where is that money coming from? What are the people with $100s of millions interested in? Are they investing in companies, are they distracted by tokens?

BF: That's what I did for my job for years an dyears. I placed billions of dollars in high-end private equity ufnds; I worked with private equity firms, global charities, sovereign wealth funds, placing hundreds of millions into things. I'm familiar with what those investors are looking at. When I got into bitcoin, it was way too small. Now some of the large investors are somewhat interested; it's not sovereign wealth funds and huge global pensions. The real serious money still isn't looking at this. It's low family officies are looking at this, but it's still quite small, and a lot of them in my opinion have fairly weak strategies becaues it's such a new area and it's so complex, it might make sense to... as a company, we have never sold anything or done anything as a company, I have done a lot individually but as a company we havne't. It makes sense to spend more time learning. This new wave of second tier big billionaire investors is that they're not taking the time to understand the tech. They are going after ICOs and they aren't really looking at it, and I think that's a bad strategy.

BAD: How do they engage with it? Do they put their coins on trezor and dump that in a safety vault?

BF: This is an interesting thing that has to be solved. The issue is custody. I get it. As a bitcoiner, I get the "not your keys, not your money" thing. But at a certain point, it falls apart. North of $100m, it's very difficult- I've managed this difficult for a long time- when you get into higher and higher levels that institutions need, you need really advanced systems. For most of them, they are just not comfortable with it. Hopefuly the things that Jameson is working on will make that easier for people. If I was an institution, I would be tempted to go with custodians, despite all the issues with that. A lot of these people aren't very technical; there's a lot of issues with holding your own keys.

TV: This is a big thing that people don't think about. Who is going to be the custodian for the bitcoin ETF? The nordics got shutdown by the SEC because there was miscommunication in the paperwork that said they were backed, but some people said ETN and the SEC said ETF. So they shut them down. The same thing happens with funds. A lot of these institutions, sure they know how to trade and how to invest, but they are not security experts. Whta you have is a couple of family offices that have piled into bitcoin and have been very vocal about it- the Drapers, the Novogratz, they have been vocal about it. There might be some smaller funds that are willing to take on the challenge of storing bitcoin, and they are going to be silent about it. You don't know they exist. They might not have giant positions. Pension funds and money managers- why would you want to risk-- they make money as a middle man. They make money not by making money, but by slightly beating the SP500 and collecting a percent on the money they manage. Why would they risk their entire operation because they stored bitcoin the wrong way? It makes no sense for a big fund to get involved in this, it's not their business model.

BAG: They are mostly trading. How do you see cryptocurrency exchanges being able to engage those traders? How do they fulfill the regulatory requirements or due diligence requirements? Are funds going to directly go to an exchange?

TV: There is no clear regulation on this. Right now the only option they have is GBTC, pink sheet which I believe is one of the worst designed financially traded product in the world which is one of the reasons why I think the SEC needs to make a decision on the ETF because this monopoly that GBTC has for investors, for people managing people's retirement accounts, it's terrible it's a terrible option and it's the only one. SEC needs to come up with something to compete with GBTC so that there's a real reflection of bitcoin that someone with a retirement account can use. We all know it's volatile, but GBTC is 20-200% more volatile on top of BTC's volatility. I think that was a huge mistake of the SEC to allow that in the first place, and now they have to rectify that by making something more efficient.

BAG: Have you seen large firms going to Bitfinex and putting money down and trading for whatever reason?

BF: A lot of them have done that through funds. I think this iwll be an evolving process. It's clear now and I will talk about this tomorrow-- that securities are a thing, they have been a thing for hundreds of years. It's a big part of the global economy. Anyone interested in.... securities are a real thing. If you represent those with tokens, some arlready are, they are just illegal, there's a few legal offerings, and then we have the writing on the wall for companies like coinbase which they have announced they are gloing to be ... The securities laws aren't going to be changed for this. You can be clever with some technical ways to make something not a security.
