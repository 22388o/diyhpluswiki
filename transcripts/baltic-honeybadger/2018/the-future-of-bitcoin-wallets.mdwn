GZ: Thank you very much. We're going to talk about the future of bitcoin wallets. As you know, it's a very central topic. We always compare bitcoin to the internet. Wallets are basically like browsers like back at the beginning of the web. They are the first gateway to a user experience for users on bitcoin. It's important to see how they will evolve. We have two exceptional representatives of the wallet world; one is Pavol Rusnak who is one of the leading contributors to the Trezor hardware wallet. It was the first publcily available commercial hardware wallet. It was the first publicly available hardware wallet. The other person on the panel is Lawrence Nahum, the creator of GreenAddress wallet. It was the first wallet implementing p2sh addresses for multisig, bip32 stuff, and the first wallet for supporting many things.

GZ: My first question to you would be, we will talk about the future of bitcoin wallets in general. Can you tell us a little bit about your perspective of bitcoin wallets? What is it that it does? Is it another boring bitcoin wallet, or is it something with some particular features and some particular added value services?

PR: Hello everybody. Like Giacomo said, we were the first available hardware wallet. The idea got into my head and slush's head around 2011. There was a conference in Prague, one of the first bitcoin conferences ever, and we were having a lot of discussions in the hallway like- okay, bitcoin is secure, but we're really not sure about common people who are not IT nerds like us whether they would be able to use it because the protection of the keys is a Key Factor here. We decided that it would be a very good idea to have a special hardware device dedicated to bitcoin wallet operations. It would keep the private key separate from an environment that might be compromised like your laptop or your operating systems that you use like Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, whatever, have 100s of millions of lines of code and it's hard to audit htat. For hardware wallets, it's much less and it's possible to go through the code. We were playing with the idea and experimenting, and it took some time, but in 2013 when we did our crowdfunding effort. It was way before ICOs so we just did regular pre-orders. Since 2014, we were able to deliver this hardware wallet to all users around the world. We've been on the market for 4 years, although the idea is a bit older. What's unique about hardware wallets is that the keys are outside of the really nasty insecure environment. At the same time, there are some limitations. Trezor has relatively small display when you compare it to the normal mobile phone or desktop screen. We have challenges about how to fit all the information we need into that small screen or space. At the same time, we want to be as precise as possible so that the user will not get confused. This are the think the unique features. We have really good security, because the private keys are off the compromised environments, but we have problems with usability because of the screen space on the hardware device is so limited.

LN: I think I started around 2012. There wree no hardware wallets available. I think they were working on it. My biggest fear was that any single device is relatively easy to compromise. To me, multisig was the solution to that problem. The big differentiating factor of GreenAddress is that it uses multisig. It allows you to have a little bit more security and improved security by keeping your keys on one device yet being able to verify things on a separate device before you confirm them. If one of your devices gets attacked, you still have some security left. Inevitably, devices will get compromised, so it's important to have multiple levels of security. As soon as hardware wallets were around, I thought it would be a great marriage for multisig and hardware wallets. This was one of our biggest differentiang factors. When I started, there was nothing that worked across devices. I wanted something tha tI could use on my desktop and also my smartphone, and at the time there was nothing like that. Last but not least, because it's multisig, you can start to enforce interesting things, not just two-factor authentication, but also threshold limits or you could start saying well since I'm part of the signature maybe I could prevent double spending and provide third-party guarantees to others that accept these funds. And this was a long time before lightning was a thing.

GZ: So this was the easy comfortable question, which was what do you do well and what is your take on bitcoin wallets. But now I can go to the nucomfortable question- we have discussed this a lot among long-term bitcoiners about business models and revenue models. The bitcoin wallet is a little bit like the browser like the Mosaic or the Netscape the first gateway. But how do you monetize that? What will be evident to people is that you can't rely on intellectual property, because if you do them properly, you're open-source in this environment or on the client side. You cannot lock the user into an enclosed environment because open protocols like bitcoin or HTTPS or SMTP is to make everybody interoperable with everyone else, and you need an open environment. You can't sell the data of your customers because the point of a good bitcoin wallet is to collect as little data on your users as possible, which is called privacy. With trezor, that's a little bit different. But assuming the hardware becomes commodity, how the hell do you guys or can you guys monetize or have a revenue model and business model to make a good business model?

PR: Our business model is trivial; when there's a gold rush, sell shovels. Hardware wallets are the shovels, in part. Our business model is just selling hardware wallets. Every piece of the service around it is free. We are aware of the fact that because everything we do is open-source, we have open specifications for hardware, all the code running on the hardware is open-source, so we already have some Trezor clones that copy the idea of a hardware wallet. Because they don't have strong R&D like we do, they can cut the prices lower. We are aware of the fact that maybe in the future once the hardware wallet is totally commoditized, we might need to change the business model. I don't think this will happen soon because people tend to buy established hardware wallets because trust is important. It doesn't make sense to save $20 on a hardware wallet and then put $1m into it. That's one point. At the same time, we're looking at different monetization efforts. Like you said, because we are open and we can't close the wallet. We're the good guys in the industry, so we don't want to sell user data. We don't even store it. I don't want to deal with the authorities asking for that data. That's another business model being used quite often by big companies, but not really applicable to us. There might be others like for example adding extra features that are not currently part of the basic package, for example I could imagine some enterprise setups using for example multisig which is great thing for a company that needs to manage budget, but not interesting for users necessarily which may need simple schemes like 2-of-3 multisig but as a company you might like intricate schemes like 2 signatures from directors or 7 signatures from vice presidents.
