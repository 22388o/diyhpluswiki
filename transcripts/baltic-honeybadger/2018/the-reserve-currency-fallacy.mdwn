The reserve currency fallacy

Eric Voskuil (evoskuil)

Thank you. Developers, developers, developers, developers. Alright, it wasn't that bad. There's a lot of content to explain this concept of the reserve currency fallacy. It's hard to get through it in the amount of available time. I'll be available at the party tonight. I want to go through four slides and talk about the history of this question of scaling, and then the first scaling proposal, second scaling proposal, and so on.

The first public discussion of bitcoin was this post on October 31, 2008 and the following post from James A. Donald from November 2, 2008. The first response to Satoshi was James talking about bitcoin and said the proposal does not seem to scale. The first problem was quickly identified. Satoshi's response was the first scaling proposal: big blocks. We've been dealing with that for a while. This isn't going to work; we can talk about how and why.

The second scaling proposal- this is Hal Finney. Sorry about the small text. Maybe too small for everyone to read, but it's important.

"Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases."

"Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others."

"George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating."

"I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today."
