Bitcoin maximalism dissected

Giacomo Zucco (giacomozucco)

Good morning everyone. I am very happy to be here at Baltic Honeybadger. Last year I gave a scaling presentation. I opened the conference with a scaling presentation. This year in order to compensate, I will be super serious. This will be the most boring presentation at the conference. I am going to try to dissect and formalize bitcoin maximalism.

This is the scarriest font I found on prezi. I wanted something with blood coming out of it but they didn't have it. So what is bitcoin maximalism? I'll try to give you a definition and do something htat has never been tried before. I want to make an axiomatic deductive treatment of bitcoin maximalism. Let's see if I have time.

As some background to this presentation, the idea for this presentation comes from an infamous tweetstorm. Basically, there was a day in May where basically Chris Pacia asked why do I think that bcashers are either malicious or stupid. He seemed interested in an honest debate about that. I tried to formalize my argument about why I do think that bcashers are either malicious or stupid.

This was great because it was the first one with 1000 likes, so for me as a social media newbie, it was great to have all this attention. It was first page on reddit for a while. It was very funny for me because I sit here coming for dinner just once to write two tweets and then 80 tweets with a lot of full ops. Social blogs are basically these ones; Eric Lombrozo and other people on twitter and on reddit asked me to create an article out of it. People particularly enjoyed that this kind of argument was very schematic, it was very like point-to-point, mathematically assembled into some kind of deduction. The format of trying to conduct of the debate, instead of name calling. I arrived at namecalling, but only after a process of logical links.

So they asked me to write a complete article out of it, which may be more readable than a tweetstorm. Some people were pissed that every tweet started with the word "stupid", so they wanted something less confrontational. Over 1000 people liking it, you cannot have everyone happy. 3 people were very disappointed with my broken English, namely bcash proponent Brian Hoffman and Chris De Rose also didn't like it. So for these three people... there was also a retweet but it's still de Rose. For these people, I was supposed to arrive again the argument with better English or some external crowdsourcing or external review.

I didn't. For two reasons. The next week, I was hosted by some podcast, the Noded bitcoin podcast, speaking about a tweetstorm. The discussion was about bcash. It was very soon considered irrelevant. The discussion moved to more general analysis of what is bitcoin maximalism. Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? Are we maximalists and are we bad persons for that? Spoiler alert, yes, but we have good reason for that. The other reason I did not write that famous article is that this user, Sosthene, basically created an article called "making the strongest case for small blocks" which was an article based on my tweetstorm and it was better than I could do so no need for me to write an article.

Since people really appreciated my tweetstorm and systematization, I'll try to do this stuff: to review the origin of the meme "bitcoin maximalism", and to condensate its doctrine into a few truths, to reach some triggering and shocking conclusions for bitcoin maximalism. People right now have this vision of bitcoin maximalists as something that is emotional... you might be a maximalist but you should try to reason with something dogmatic; you're maximalist because you can't analyze this question with an open mind, you have already reached a conclusion and you can't change it. And maximalists are "toxic"; if you see the word "toxic", you should walk away because it's usually someone who can't conversate with you logically. Some people say maximalists are creating a bad environment and people feel unwelcome because of this. Maximalist means rude; you have to be kind of a dick in order to be maximalist, and it's like... rude... we are maximalists, we don't eat carbs, we are sad.

Instead, I'll try to make the point it's actually the other way around- maximalism is a rational conclusion. I was not maximalist in 2012. I had to made a consideration to get there. It's empirical, based on facts and logical connections between facts. It's not toxic. It's super healthy for the ecosystem. It's needed. It's part of the physiology of bitcoin and it's not part of the pathology of bitcoin. Ultimately, it's generous, it's something that has an altruistic affect. It's also sometimes considered costly for people who practice bitcoin maximalism, in order to help the greater good. It's lots of fun, it's not gloomy. You can have a lot of fun as a maximalist. I do.

My objective, the real purpose of this presentation is to be able to draw graphs about this. There was one from David Puell about the essence of bitcoin, based on a diagram from Pierre Rochard. I failed to make a similar diagram at 3am this morning. You could also make a taxonomy like Eric Voskuil on the libbitcoin wiki. You find not just tools but great explanations of cryptoeconomics which is indexed with this very cool titles like "Credit expansion fallacy" and "empty block fallacy" and "fragmentation principle". The names are cool, and the content is really cool as well. Check out the "axiom of resistance" or look at "the blockchain fallacy". I don't agree with the "hearn error".. the names are good. It's a lot of stuff.. The lunar fallacy.. it's really a lot of fun.

let's start with the word bitcoin maximalist. Bitcoin maximalist is something that was invented by Vitalik Buterin in November 2014. He started to address another user on reddit as a bitcoin dominance maximalist. Soon later he posted an article called "On bitcoin maximalism, and currency and platform network effects". Vitalik isn't good at writing cryptographic systems, but he's great at writing blog posts and systematizing an idea. This is a skill he mostly uses for marketing or scams, but it's still a skill. I respect that. This article is so great that his idea was to shame bitcoin maximalists because they are wrong. But the systematization, the steelmanning of the argument was so good that some people enjoyed being called bitcoin maximalism.

Back then, many people reacted to this article and said yeah I'm a bitcoin maximalist. So the pejorative nickname was twisted into something that people are proud to be. In the last few months, I have people coming to me and saying they are bitcoin maximalists... but they are not bitcoin maximalists because they are talking about permissioned blockchains or something. So they are using the term because it has some legitimacy. There are some objections, like "In reality, bitcoiners are minimalists while ethereum /bcash fans are the maximalists". Maximalism is about more is more, and minimal is less is more. If you think about block size or turing completeness or rich statefulness, it's clear that maximalism should be in the shitcoin camp not in ours. But it's a little bit too late to change this name after we took possession of bitcoin maximalism, culturally speaking. Also somebody started to call themselves a "shitcoin minimalist". I'm not a bitcoin maximalist, I'm a shitcoin minimalist. It's more consistent, but it doesn't get a lot of traction. People still tend to call themselves a "bitcoin maximalist". Someone else, Amelianiiusu Aglai suggested "bitcoin supremacists". I would not be comfortable with that term, it could be a problem. My conclusion is that we can stick with "bitcoin maximalism" even if etymologically speaking it might not be appropriate definition.

So now it's time to systematize or to create a minimal viable list of characteristics of a bitcoin maximalists. What I'm going to present here, I know many of you are buddhists, but I'm not. Buddhists were based on the four universal truths. Here's the four universal truth of maximalists. The first turth is that everything which is not bitcoin is a scam. The second universal truth is that every attempt at changing bitcoin is a scam. The third universal truth is that every attempting at pushing people to spend bitcoin is a scam. The fourth universal truth is that we shouldn't be nice to scammers. This can seem to you as a little counterintuitive like paradoxical even. Probably you think these are not the results of logical thinking, perhaps you think these are dogmatic or rude. What I'm trying to do here is to perform an axiomatic deduction of these four truths from first principles we can hopefully agree on.

I will spend a few minutes talking about the assumptions. I wanted to be Eric Voskuil and assign some cool names to the assumptions. The first assumption is hard-vs-easy and it goes something like this: money which is hard to create and to censor... etc.. if you don't agree with one of these 10 assumptions, then you will disagree with the four universal truths. You'd be wrong, but you're free to be wrong. The first assumption is that money which is hard to creat e(money trap) and to censor (financial control) is osmething difficult to have, especially in the age of the internet and under orwellian regimes. We have plenty of alternative for money which is easy to create and to censor, and when we cannot use htem it's because we need hard money instead. It could be really disruptive.
