Security and usability.

Elizabeth: I think this is a highly relevant discussion. I talked a bit about regulation. Regulation might be the number threat, but security might be the number two threat. I am excited to have a pane lof leaders in this space who are actively building in this ecosystem. I am going to ask each to do a quick intro.

Alan: I am the original creator of Armory and the Armory Bitcoin wallet. Last year I gave an introduction to Bitcoin. We have been around since 2011. I started to acquire Bitcoin from mining. Now we are developing enterprise solutions on the topic of security and usability they would say that Armory does not have usability at top of mind. Others have that in mind. Our focus is security though. That's where we're going with large institutions who have the resources to get over the usability and do the security right.

Malani: I got into Bitcoin in 2011. I was doing a PhD sponsored by Microsoft at the time. I became utterly fascinated by it. I spent the next couple years figuring out how to do something meaningful in this space. Biometrically secure will be launching in a couple weeks.

Kristov: I started writing a book about Bitcoin privacy. That is a topic that I care about quite a bit.

Elizabeth: What do you see as the biggest pro and biggest con in terms of Bitcoin security?

Malani: I think one of the biggest limitations is the users themselves. I think  that placing responsibility in the hand of users is often times there is human error. Losing a piece of paper and private keys.
