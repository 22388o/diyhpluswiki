We're here to talk about security. We have a great panel of individuals representing internationally and domestically in the US Government as well as external synbio audience as well. So the first talk will be from Sean Donahue.

Sean: I'm going to talk about what we look at and what we do. One of the international partners from Holland was saying it was hard to find who to talk with. That's the main focus of my job. It's creating that bridge between themselves and law enforcement. For Biocurious, I'm that person. When something comes off, they can call me and bounce an idea off of me. When their equipment is stolen or material stolen, if you call it into the local police, they might freak out by what's in there. And that might turn into the same situation as Kurt from back in 2004. We try to mitigate that. Biocurious can talk with myself, and I can talk with local law enforcement to let them know what's going on. There's nothing nefarious going on, they're great folks. We're not intrusive. I'm not knocking on the door, coming in unannounced. That's the opposite of what we're doing. We're not regulatory. We're not trying to see what you have, what equipment you have, do you meet your safety requirements, that's not what we're about.

To address another point: why are we looking at DIYbio? It originally started from iGEM. But also it comes from Congress and people angry about unregulated amateur biology groups. We can now stand up and say that we're talking with the amateur communities, and that they are doing good work - it's non-traditional, a whole different group of people. The non-traditional route has different backgrounds with people not from academia. They are educating themselves into a new area. That's what I am. I am that conduit. If something does happen, and they need to talk with law enforcement, or needs someone to explain to a local enforcement agency, I can be that person. We don't have a centralized law enforcement system in the US. All police departments are paid for and funded on a local county, state basis. The FBI is an investigative force, we're not a police force. We're pretty small if you look at our numbers and how we're spread out.

We have relationships with all law enforcement agencies. We have people in most squads, either just for gang activity, organized crime, public corruption cases, that's what we're there. I would also try to branch out not just law enforcement but also your local public health officials. You should let them know that you're there, I have great working relationships wth all the public health people in the Bay Area. So if these people need help, they can reach out to myself. We know the hospitals, we know the research instiutes that are there, and they might not know that you are there, and they might find it useful that you're out there and this is what we're doing, and we're good people.

That's the focus of what the WMD coordinator does. It might be a bit different than in NYC. On the east coast, they are in a suit and tie. We're a bit more relaxed. That's what I do, just my job. We do events coordination, we have the US Open Golf tournament this week, and we have to have people on standby response for that, and that's all I have for this time. We'll take questions at the end.

Nate: Next up we have Chris Anderson from SynBERC to give a presentation.
Nate: Next up is Meg Flanagan from Dept of State.
