Good morning. I am the token capitalist in the room. I am going to speak a little bit about a meeting that was held last March, which was a great meeting. I think there are a half dozen people here who went to this meeting. Just so you could raise your hands so folks could know who you are. I don't see Tomas. Anyway, so, if you want to ask further questions about these meetings in the break, we have some folks here who were there.

The meeting was held in March, and the sponsor was the International Council for the Life Sciences out of the UK, which was tremendously helpful in convening a very wide array of people involved in syntheticc biology and security issues. It was funded by the Sloan Foundation, FBI and UK. What was critical about it was the attendees- both commercial and government people. It was the first meeting that pulled together all the constituents including the citizen scientists, it was the first time we had everyone around the table.

The purpose was around biosecurity and screening issues. Let me take one step back on this. As you probably know, the US Dept of Health/Services has developed a protocol for screening matter and recipients of matter for the industry to use. It has become not mandatory, it's not a mandatory regime, it's a voluntary regime. The key players on the commercail side- the 5 companies responsible for 80% of the synthetic biology products that are sold, have all signed on. That group has also created the International IGSC, which is the something for Synthetic Biology. And we got our own screening.

So, at the meeting, the intent was to take these voluntary codes and try to .. both globally and throughout sectors working in synthetic biology. The idea is that if we can get voluntary compliance across the board, we reduce the risk that people who want these bad things will get them. With individual citizen scientists, companies and others represented, we were able to bring that conversation to the front.

Among the ideas that was discussed was making a whitelist to go along with the blacklist. So, labs would have a tracklist of things that is pre-approved. The idea was to create a level of trust that would prove what their motives is, to reduce the beauracratic risk and so on. 

Heidelberg Biosecurity Meeting was the first time we had this opportunity to brng these people together. This was the first time we had the synthetic biology China people. A lot of the work is being done in China with relatively less oversight or control on biosecurity/biosafety issues, as compared to the US or UK. So having the Chinese around the table with us was really important and we're proud about that.

So the follow-up was that there are a number of issues discussed, like compound screening, recipient screening, and we created some taskforces that cut across the various sectors to try to come up with some workable solutions that find the right blend between biosecurity/biosafety, and scientific/academic freedom on the other. WE are going to continue the process in December in Hong Kong in December at the ICSBG conference.

Tomas was the representative from the citizen scientist community for this conference, and I am sure he would have lots to add if you would like to speak during the break.
