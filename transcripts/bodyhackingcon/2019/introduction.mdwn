Hello. Hi everyone. We're going to start our day. If you want to come grab a seat, let's talk about a few things before we get started. Hi. I'm Angel Giufrria. I will be your friendly cyborg host for the weekend. Let me put my lights on, that would be fancy and festive. It's great to be here. It's my second year hosting. It's the 4th annual bodyhacking conference. It's great to see some familiar faces and lots of new faces.

Thank you to our sponsors including LZR and Trammell Ventures, White Rabbit Conspiracy and others. If you're looking for t-shirt sales or pickups, it wont start until 2pm. Over here, we have signups for our workshops. There are a few changes. Lunch will be offsite. We have an expo room and all of our vendors. We will have some surprise guest speaker at her slot at 215 so look out for that.

Brian Bushway is absolutely amazing. He will tell you all about it. Enjoy Brian.
