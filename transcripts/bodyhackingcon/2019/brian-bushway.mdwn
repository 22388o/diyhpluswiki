# Introduction

Hello everybody. Welcome. Let's get started. Let's first give a round of applause for all the volunteers. Thank you to all the sponsors for making this event possible.

For the next few moments, I am going to share some stories from my life. We will watch some videos, and also do some sound experiments.

# Seeing in the dark

I lost my vision at the age of 14. But now I have a masters degree in special education. I get invited from all around the world to help countries, charities and organizations to develop programming for how does the brain image acoustically. The brain can image acoustically. In the last 20 years, neuroscience has been able to prove this.

We all have heard that if you lose one sense, the other senses get stronger. It has everything to do with neuroplasticity. The lifehack that we can all learn today is that every human being has the ability to see in the dark. So why are we all still afraid of the dark? Every human being has this natural resource of imaging acoustically.

# Spatial processing center

They did fMRI scans of colleagues and our brains. They found that the brain takes auditory information, sends it to the visual cortex, and those parts of the brain are activated by an echo. The object recognition parts of the brain are activated by an echo. The visual cortex is really misnamed. We should really think of it as a spatial processing center.

Does anyone remember any classes on how you as a little toddler were trained to use your vision? No, there's really no classes. We just encourage people to get out there and go play, and people would throw balls at you and if you didn't catch it then you would get hit in the head. Some adults still have horrible hand-eye coordination. Well, if you practice enough, you can have ear-hand coordination if you make the environment audible and accessible.

There's real hope for all of us in our lives because our brains are already geared to do amazing things. The hardest part about changing the neuropathways in our brain is developing enough motivation to persevere through those adaptation changes.

Today, I would like to focus on two natural resources that we all have that I think most of us are not fully capitalizing on. The first one is our ability to be adaptable, which we all get because we're here. The other one is, how can we be more creative?

# Backstory

When I lost vision at the age of 14, it forced my hand to adapt and be more creative and I was forced into a life situation where I had to hack my other senses and make them better. But before I get into imaging acoustically, I have the problem of simply being a human being. I'm a human being first, before I happened to be blind or vision impaired. What happens is that as soon as you get a white cane and people see the label, they put you in a box and the other human beings are in the other box. It gets confusing, because we think that a person who has a disability doesn't have the same needs or desires as everybody else.

At 14, you don't really know you're losing your vision until it kind of goes. Has anybody hung out with your parents or grandparents and they can't really hear anymore? They don't even know what they are missing. They can't hear. It happens at such a gradual pace, you don't even know what you're missing.

So there I was at 14, we were all into rollerblading with my buddies. I could barely see 8 feet in front of me. I was skating. You sort of fake it until you make it, you keep them in the visual threshold and you follow and keep going. We were taunting each other, telling bad mom jokes, and before you know it I was going down a ramp and down the visual field I realized I was crossing a street and I couldn't tell if it was red or green to go. I slammed on my breaks, and there were horns honking. I collected myself, crawled back up on the corner and all my friends are gone. They have no idea. Vision loss is a hard thing to communicate to your buddies. But now I was stranded on this corner wondering how I was going to get home. There were so many streets to cross, and I couldn't see across this street right now. I figured, shoot, I have enough vision to get into trouble but not enough vision to get out of trouble.  I'm stuck. And I didn't even have cell phones back then.

So I took a few deep breaths. Another deep breath. I started calming myself. As I calmed myself, I was able to think more logically. I was able to think in more creative ways. I figured it was safe to cross when perpendicular traffic wasn't in motion. I skated incredibly slow and eventually caught up with my friends. The first lesson in being a human being was that before I could solve the problems of blindness, the first problem was that I was emotionally blind. My emotions got the best of me, they were crowding all of my other thought about how we adapt and get out of this situation.

# Video

Even tomorrow some of us will do a more deep dive in sensory immersion, and we're going to fast from our dependency on artificial light and we're going to learn to pay attention to the rest of the information that is all still there.

The discovery in my life was moving from this place of feeling lost and feeling scarcity, and then rediscovering a whole new life of abundance and hope and beauty in the world of images.

In this next video I am going to show you, these are all human beings that have an interesting uniqueness. They all have something in common. That's their ability to get beyond their life situation. We're going to watch a music video called "Reneges" by the ex ambassadors. So to pay attention to everyone in the video, you're going to see us on a mountain bike and a bunch of my other friends. Please enjoy this video.
