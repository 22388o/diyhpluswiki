PeerJ
Pete Binfield

I we can set a goal, to sequence the human genome for $99, then why not the same for academic publishing? It just launched this week and we are fortunate to hear the inside scoop of a very ambitious new model.

We launched on Tuesday. The people behind it are myself, the one journal to rule the world was justm entioned and I used to run PLOS One, and it actually is the one journal to rule the world. It's going to publish about 3% this year, about 25,000 articles. I left four weeks ago to do this. My co-founder is Jason from Mendeley. He left back in December. We've been working on this for about 6 months. It was originally his concept.

So uh. I thought I'd give you a quick overview about what academic publishing. Not everyone is knee-deep. This is our original pitch deck to VCs. Academic researchers have an obligation to publish in order to advance their careers. The scholarly journal market is dominated by subscription publishers that charge thousands of dollars for an annual subscription, and you have to hand over the copyright and content to the publishers. So it's artificially restricted. That's a $10 billion/year industry and highly profitable. It's subsidized by the free labor of the academics that write for free, they review for free and so on.

The interesting development in thelast 10 years has been open access whih is about 10 years old now. It wants to distribute content freely without restrictions, like with Creative Commons. The model is that the author pays and the author pays the processing charge. Thsi is typically in the range of $1300-$5000 per article they publish. This pays publication costs.

What is open access? In the journal world it's a distribution model, not a business model. The author pays thing is not the concept of open access. Open access is usually licensed under CC. The broadest definitino is CC-BY 3.0. Although some publishers try to add a NC term to it. This is the gold standard of open access licensing to appyl. If you apply that license, your content can be reused, remixed and redistributed for free provided that you acknowledge the original service.

Commercial products and applications can be built on top of OA content, provided that you have not applied the NC subterm. Anyone can repackage and sell it off. We want to encourage more of that because it hasn't been happening in the OA world. OA is rapidly disrupting the established subscription model.

OA honestly improves accelerates and facilitates academic progress. It's a good thing in the world and the world deserves its academic content to be published like that, how can you build a business model like this and how d oyou persuade the world? OA is disruptive. This is a recentp aper that is trying to predict the disruption curve of OA. It's about 15% of the world' scontent right now. This study predicts that by 2017 that about 50% of all scholarly articles will be OA. By 2019 it might be 90%. They did this by extrapolating the Christenson disruption curve. The speed of which.. has been growing.. PLOS One has been dubling in size, 3% this month but next month might be 5%. If you roll that out over OA in general, I wouldn't be surprised that within 5 or 8 years that we will have complete disruption of the publishing industry.

This is the curve for PLOS One through the end of 2011. It's publishing a pheneomonal amount, about 2k articles/month and that's growing each month.

So what is PeerJ? We are a new OA publisher, we are publisher of an academic journal that looks a lot like PLOS ONe. It's PeerJ. We have a preprint server called PeerJ Preprint, and teh two work together. Authors can submit to the preprint server, or others can submit directly to the jounral. The two are tightly integrated. The most interesting thing is that.. I mentioned that the standard business model is that authors pay for publishing each time, and that payment of $1300-$5000.. we are shifting that model so that you don't pay to publicize, you pay to become a member of PeerJ, you subscribe and by being a member you get lifetime rights to publish future papers with us for free. It's a very different psychological motivator.

How do you incentivze peer review? There are some innovations there as well. In order to remain a member in good standing, you must review once per year, it can be a peer review, it can be a comment on an article. We want to encourage the community to contribute to the community. The end result is that everything is OA under a CC license.

I thought that this would be interesting, this is straight off of our website. These are the guiding principles that we are building PeerJ from. We are an innovative company that serves the academic community that attetmps to drive costs down. Literally we believe that we are going to take the best features of traditional publishing worlds, all the traditional benefits around archiving, peer review, versions of records, we are going to marry that up to modern internet technology to improve that process. We are a service industry for academia. WE serve academia and not the other way around. THis is what's needed to get the company off the ground. We want the prices to get down and lower.

What are the prices? We launched on Tuesday, if you become a basic member, that's $99 and that's a lifetime right to publish one paper a year with the journal. That remains to be seen. I think, we're pretty confident. Enhanced is $199 and that's 2 papers/year. The $300 is the right to publish an unlimited number of papers per year. You can upgrade at any point, the catch is that all contributory authors have to be a member. Each of the authors on the paper have to be a member in good standing. So all their future papers are free. There is also this requirement to do a review every year per member.

Some of the interesting things is that all of our content is CC-BY. We will make a sfotware platform for peer review, we have Public APIs, we are going to open source a bunch of our stuff, and it will be a cultur eof innovation. Anyone that wants to build tools to interoperate with ourselves, we'd love to talk with you. We launched on Tuesday, and this is the great reception we got. We got great media coverage, we lined up interviews in Science Magazine, Times Magazine, Nature, we got started with an overwhelmigly positive response. There are some doubters coming out of the woodworks but in general everyone has been very positive.

The award for the best headline is that: New OA Journal Lets Scientists Publish Until They Perish. That's PeerJ. Thank you.
