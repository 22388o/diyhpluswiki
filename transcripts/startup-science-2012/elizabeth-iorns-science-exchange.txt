Science Exchange
Elizabeth Iorns

So, um. We started thinking yesterday about what to talk here. I thought about the different aspects of bringing the tech ideas into the science space. Some of the key points that Joseph wrote about was catalyzing the formation of teams and companies that positively transform science. The emergence of a new type of science entrepreneurs to .. effect contemporary relationship. That's inspirational and inspiring and it's exciting to think about how to encourage scientists to consider this alongside the academic careers that we all know about.

I came from a traditional academic career path. I did my PhD in London and I did a postdoc at University of Miami. I was ddoing academic research until I realized that there were problems that I could address with technology, and it was more exciting than running a lab. So then I founded scienceexchange.com. Today I hope to share some lessons about starting a company that might help other scientists with the transfer. I am really happy to help people make a transition to this career.

Just a brief introduction to what Science Exchange is.. it's an online market space where people pay for services from institutions. It wsa for building access to expertise and infrastructure in a marketplace. Instead of a local core facility at your own institution, what about a portal where researchers could transact on expertise available outside their institution and globally.

So we were founded last year in May, we launched in August, we are based in Palo Alto and took part in the ycombinator S11 program. We built our product quickly, we raised a seed round of financing including Jason Harowitz, and Cross Sight amongst others. So we now are used by more than 1000 core facilities across the United States. There are some nice brand names like MIT, Harvard and Stanford.

We have critical mass and we have users accessing core facilities they wouldn't have had access to anyway. I don't want to talk about this. I want to talk about why I created Science Exchange. I would be happy to answer questions about creating a startup in this space.

You need to solve a real problem. Often there is technology searching for problems, especially the young guys coming into ycombinator. I was one of only two women out of 164 people in the program. Almost everyone was young, white males, all engineers straight out of college. They are so talented and brilliant- some of the smartest people I've ever interacted with- they were looking for problems and weren't sure what to use these skills to solve. When thinking about building a startup, you need to research the market and maek sure that the problem exists. If you are going to make a tech startup, building a small one is just as hard as a big one so you might as well solve a hard problem.

So the Science Exchange mission was that core facilities is increasingly important, but access is just as hard. So we talked with a lot of scientists, and I was able to understand as a scientist that it was a problem that people experienced on a daily basis. So we were able to get numbers on $100B spent on research every year, much of that through things other than core facilities, but increasingly so.

So, do something you're really passionate about. I love this quote from Paul Graham. The best problems to solve are the ones that effect you personally. You have to understad the problem that you are trying to address. Often this can be hard when you are starting a company. The problem you are solving has to be important. You have to have that connection. For me and my own research, my credit card balance was effected by the lack of a good marketplace.

Make a start. It's hard to make that first step, that initial step into this world, especially if you're not from the tech community. It can be really scary, and you might not know what to do to start a company. But one of the things that... and get on with building a company.

You need to share your idea. One of the problems was that people thought their ideas would be stolen. You shouldn't tell anyone, and my cofounders were both in the tech startup world. No, that's not the way you do it, tell everyone about your idea so that you can get feedback and build something that people really want. That was a valuable lesson. We started with market research and we thought about the problem, and whether people found this to be a problem, and then we applied to ycombinator. That was from February 2011 to taking ycombinator in May. Making a start and making progress was what allowed us to make a successful company.

Surround yourself with the right people. If you actually look at all these companies, these startups were often done by a single founder. When you're looking for investment, or skills required to actually get up and running, it's important to have diversity in that team so that you can handle any of the problems that you will be addressing. Science Exchange has 3 very different founders. I am an academic scientist, we have a technical engineer and a business person. That diversity has really helped us with understanding all sorts of different problems that has helped us with building a company.

Do things that don't scale. If you have a really complicated accounting, dealing with transactions, I have to build this technology around that.. and then being a part of ycombinator is valuable because Paul was like, that's a great problem to have. You should just get started, start taking money manually, and then you will figure it out when you need to. Only scale when you need to. Doing things manually was actually really important, to understand our customers and see what they needed, and that when we needed to scale that we were doing so in an important way. Customer service is super valuable when you are starting.

The sixth point is to listen to your users. This goes back to the customer support. This is a really interesting quote. Customers are used to companies ignoring them. Some startups have fanatic loyalty from their initial users.. might not have the best product, or might have a shitty website with errors, but they reach out and engage with the users, and that personal interaction creates a community around the product that is extremely loyal. That was something really valuable from the start, it was making sure that when they tweeted that we would reply to them, we were calling them and visiting them and making sure they feel involved in the community of Science Exchange.

Don't always do what they say. If they have a problem, you should listen, but their solution might not be the best solution. Your company is your company, and it is up to you that to figure out how to solve the problem most optimally.

The seventh one is iterate quickly. This is true of startups in general. Iterating enough times until you find something that works until you run out of money. That's really a startup. I think when you have this really early users that interacted with you and are your community and driving your growth, you can listen to them, they want you to speak and improve quickly, they don't want you to just sit around. So, that's really important for iterating quickly.

When we first launched, our product was post a project and we would find someone to do the experiment for you. That was a frustrating experience. But we physically went to the person, and we checked if the person was able to do it. You don't know if anyone would be able to help you, we switched from this auction model to an order model. We built a database where we exposed the value from the start, we had the ability to see and filter, see the feedback on using those core facilities from other users. So exposing the site right from the interaction of the site, and that was frustrating for people who were posting projects, but it helped providers because they didn't have to post and miss out on work. So when someone was actually requesting, then they were more likely to actually order and they already went through that process.

Get the right investors and advisors. This is something that I never realized before coming to SV. When we talk about the type of startups that we're talking about today, they are around infrastructure changes and technology, they are not the equivalent of biotech startups. We're facing a marketplace that is similar to Airbnb or Odesk that are very different from the problems that Genentech faced. These are very different advisors from Biotech companies. THis is probably true of other scientist startups. ResearchGate has more similarities to Kaggle or Faceboeok, not the other sites. PeerJ is more similar towards sites like youtube or spotify that have to license content from providers.

For us when we were thinking about adivsors, we looked at talents that could help us with an online marketplace and understand the things we need to put in place. We had Jason Horowotizz, including the OpenTable person, and the Airbnb person and the former CEO of Ebay, and this helped us figure out our problems.

The ninth lesson is to commit. I think this is something that is very hard to do. It is very scary that you need to have these backup plans, I need to keep my day job and all of tehse kind of things that you put in place where, if it does fail- which it will, by the way- that you are not kept high and dry. I think that's a self-defeating attitude. If you truly believe that your startup is a good idea, and you're executing on it well, then you need to commit to it and go to it. There is a limited runway and enthusiastic energy. When you start, you get enthusiastic, make the phone calls and do all the hard things that are not fun. Over time you will lose that energy, so you do need to make progress so that you don't lose your energy, otherwise your startup will fail.

Finally, you need to have fun. At Science Exchange, it's the only time you will ever have to work with people you choose with and to do the things you want to do. We want to make sure our team is happy with each other, we're good friends, we do things outside of work as well as working on the startup. That's what we focus on at Science Exchange as well.

I am really happy to make introductions for people, or giving advice and doing science startups. You can reach me at elizabeth@scienceexchange.com.
