Assay Depot

We built Assay Depot about five years ago. So I'd have to say compared to PeerJ we're a little long in the tooth so to speak. We're still a startup in many ways. We're a virtual company based out in San Diego. We have been quietly for five years building web based tools for scientists with the sole goal of empowering laboratory scientists.

We have been focusing on two classes of scientists, no value judgement implied. We want to include citizen scientists and academic scientists. But also pharmaceutical scientists. They involve a similar product. If we're talking about citizen scientist, the problem is that- if you are interested in doing life science research- at some point, big data or not, you need to do laboratory experiments. Lab experiments are incredibly expensive- expensive equipment, experts for setting up the study or analyzing it, or they involve some sort of tracking or project management tool. Your average citizen scientist does not have access to those capabilities.

So Assay Depot built a public web-based laboratory. We want to tap into the collective latent scientific talent that is outside of professional science. It allows any citizen scientist with appropriate funding to translate their ideas into experiments and into action in a nutshell. So at one place, located at assaydepot.com you can search for services, you can communicate with experts, you can raise services, you can track eerything that you're doing.

We enable online access to over 20,000 online laboratories. You can go to our website, search through our taxonomy, and you might find things like a book on Amazon. So antibodies put in prices and turn around times. If you click the title of these services, you can get into the actual science going on. You can read the science that the vendor has put in. You can fully put in the.. vendor can go in and continually update their research so scientists can have access to new research as they are created. It's really become that simple.

You can notice that the orange button says request info, you can click that and establish a dialog with this particular vendor. It's like skype chat where you actually communicate back and forth. In our database we have 6,000 research providers including CROs and consultants, core labs at universities that Elizabeth was referring to. We've divided the life science process, focusing primarily on drug discovery, into 550 different areas. It's very simple to go to the site, browse through the taxonomy, click on any link, and see a list of every vendor in the world that offers services in that category.

You can request quotes, transfer files, see bids, all in that one simple page. This is a pharmacology page, there's in vitro technology, infectious diseases, click on any one of these links and you will see every vendor that we have identified or they hvae self-identified for that particular category. On the lower left is inflammation model, let's say I've done some research, but I need an arthritis model.. what do I do today? Well, you can just go here and click on my arthritis link where you can see the 75 vendors in the world that offer these. You can reach out and contact them or all 75 at once. It's not an ecommerce fashion, you can ask questions and establish a dialog with any of these vendors simultaneously.

You can reply to 50 people at the same time to tell them that you're not interested. You can simply go in and search Alzheimer's disease, maybe you have an iddea. Instead of looking for an academic partner, maybe you can go in and pay $5k and $10k which is not a trivial thing, but you could get a disease model carried out for you. I should have mentioned that it is completely absolutely free, there's no charge for scientists to use this platform. We fund it through a different mechanism.

Citizen scientists can now run any drug discovery experimetns, wyou have immediate access to services, and if it's not one of the twenty thousand already listed, you can already create services that aren't listed. We have thousands of users in over 50 different countries, we have 10k uniques per month- it's not that much, but it's increasing. We receive more than 1000 requests/month that comes through the system. We have processed over 16000 requests most of that coming in the past 2 years. In the first 2 years of the project, there was no market and it was low key, so we were just growing it organically.

We have over 6000 suppliers including consultants, over 1000 have come to our member portal or expert are actually using this system. We have had 1200 vendors come into the system over the last 18 months. Atul Butte left a comment.
