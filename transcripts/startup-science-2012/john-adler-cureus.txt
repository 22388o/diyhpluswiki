Thanks Joseph. I am probably the age of your father in most cases. I am going to talk about the concept in peer review publishing, we believe that the web can be transformational in the way that medical publishing is traditionally done.

Medical publishing and peer review can't be emphasized enough. Peer review defines standard of care, whether a hospital or physician chooses to pursue things. CMS doesn't pay unless there are references that endorse it. Publishing is critical for institutions to develop their institutions and their communities. Publication is at the center of developing therapies and drugs. $2.5T industry at the center of that healthcare industry is all peer reviewed back. One end of the spectrum is the 200 year old New England Journal of Medicine. To what extent do physicians go to develop their reputation? A critical component is publishing.

What exists today? The old fashion peer reviewed journal. Papers take at least a month, or even years. It's very political. I have been part of this process for my professional career. I understand it. I have done this. It's slow. It's balkanized. You can't find the contents you want. When I publish in the neurosurgery journal, it's a conscious decision to not publish it in 10 or 15 other journals on anesthesiology or urology journal, in many ways there are many adjacent areas of interests and these opthamologists will never see what I publish, the system keeps growing in content and the financial scheme is retarded. Nobody will see it.

When I work in an operating room, I get paid $1k/hour. But the work here, nothing. In the end, I have to pay when I have color prints of my articles. I have to pay when I want copies to give to patients. While there is an online kind of access, open access movement, it really hasn't harped on the world of medicine today. The culture is just so unique. Right here is an example in this past week, the paper was rejected by several of the best journals in the world. Why? Because, I don't know why. Nobody knows why. Someone wasn't happy. In the end, this is an important paper that for the first time describes a new method to treatment.

The existing world is fragmented, access is difficult to have. A week ago, at Stanford, with this great library network that pays $3-4M a year to give you access to the journals, looked up a paper in the Journal of Clinical ONtology, a journal that I gave multiple papers to in the past, but I hit a paywall. I came from Stanford but didn't mean squat. I paid $15-$20 to get that. Most papers are locked up behind paywalls despite that I want access or my patients more and more want access. Their life is on the line. Many patients want to know the leading research. Some of the patients are interested, they are making high-value decisions, they get a $100k operation at UCSF, do they get an outpatient procedure at El Camino? These are $10k decisions. That's a lot of money.

In the end, it's a very unsocial thing. Every paper has as social network who cares about it, but it's almost anonymous and you're just a cog working in a cubicle.

So, the current system is broken. It's too costly, too inaccessible, and it's filled with discredited systems for defining and finding quality. John and I found that the literature pointed out how papers had been retracted for fraud, 10 years from now, still are in the scientific literature because they were published in Nature or Science. It's a BS system. How do you change it?

I think there are really good ideas for changing the world of basic science. We are moving in a kind of related waters. In parallel, medicine is very unique. Our solution, most everyone in this room believes that publishing needs to be faster. We need to remove the political biases, like that paper on addiction I mentioned that took 2 years to get published. We all believe in Creative Commons and that atuhors should retain copyright. We all believe that. In high-value procedure-based medicine should be made. We're in that position.

Physicians love to be scored. We are judged our entire lives. Part of this is that we part tests all the time. We came p with a proprietary high-value crowdsourcing tool called SBIQ impact quotient. Who is evaluating a paper? Not just the number of people, it's not like/dislikes or thumbs up, it's about who likes it or who doesn't like it. That tells a lot about whether you an expert or not. The world doesn't need 5000 journals, it needs one comprehensive ournal. It needs a global one. Enterprise. for which there aren o barriers between content between specialties. SO much of the content that I want is not in my usual literature.

We are trying to fosture the notion that journals have served as reptuation engines for physicians and reeviewers. We can make the system fun. Make it fun. When you start publishing the papers in medical school or esidency, you enjoy the process. When you get to my age, you get so fed up with the process that you want to blow it up. It's about discovery and explanation, it's fun. That's what physicians went into medicine for.

What are we doing? We're building on My Son's Legacy, that was incubated in my living room, fueled by coco cola, he owes me. So, I watched this company - Academia.edu, scripp, researchgate, sermo, doximity. Scribd, mendeley, plosone, altmetrics, world science. Peer reviewed medicine has incredible work; here there are a lot of range of scientists, many of these websites you know about - there are whole new tools that we are developing, as well as these social connections work well with this. We want to nail nail nail the peer review concept. THe peer review concept is so critical to traditional medicine.

We're moving forward. In the end it's a blend of the old and the new. We are about content. There's a social element but it's not the focus. The focus is on medicine content, medical content, and high-value ... this is a ... in the end, thisk resovlution will have to be about disinfected insider. I am a disinfected insider. I want revolution. It's always about the revolution. This is like from the 60s, so that other old guy in the room gets that.

I welcome you all and your support, let's kick the tires, give us ideas, this is about democritizing medical publsihing at the world at large.
