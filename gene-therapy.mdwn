(patent) [Nanoparticle-mediated gene delivery, genomic editing and ligand-targeted modification in various cell populations](https://patents.google.com/patent/CA2924535A1)

conjugation of PEI for DNA binding, histone tail peptide for nuclear localization, poly-glutamic acid, glutamic acid for stabilization and charge balancing or whatever, then you stick DNA to it, and silica coat the whole thing, then add even more cell-targeting stuff to the outside.

# other

* poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based nanoparticles
* hybrid nanoparticles such as liposome-polycation-DNA (LPD) nanoparticles
* lipopolyplexes
