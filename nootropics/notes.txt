B12 transdermal patch

For instance, acetylcholine is the primary nerotransmitter related to information processing. Acetylcholinerase is responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine. There are multiple supplements that will increase acetylcholine production, among them CDPCholine, alphaGPC, DMAE, centrophenoxine and Acetyl L Carnitine. If you double up, you simply hit a ceiling on the amount of acetylcholine available. Also, many nootropics such as huperzine A inhibit acetylcholinerase. Inhibiting acetylcholinerase has the same effect as producing more acetylcholine.

piracetam

    take choline with piracetam
cdpcholine
sulbutiamine
    tends to prevent mental fatigue
    synthesized version of thiamine (crosses blood-brain barrier better than thiamine)
    thiamine reserves play a role in mental endurance
    broken down into thiamine parts (vitamin B1)
pyritinol
    increases alertness, energy and ability to concentrate
    super version of vitamin B6
picamilion
    GABA reduces nervous excitement
    GABA cannot cross the blood-brain barrier
    picamilion is a synthesis of niacin (vitamin B3) and GABA that was designed to cross the blood-brain barrier.
    picamilion is broken down to niacin and GABA
aniracetam
    derived from piracetam, but has different effects
lion's mane
    increases production of nerve growth factor (NGF)
    NGF is responsible for determining the rate at which new brain cells are produced
