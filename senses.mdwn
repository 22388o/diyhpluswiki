##sensory substitution
neuroscientist [bach y rita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bach-y-Rita) 
came up with the idea of [sensory substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_substitution)
to bring sight to the blind with a mesh of electrodes on the tongue or skin of 
the back.

fish sense their environment through electric field receptors on the medial line 
running down their sides. capacitive sensors are easy to build, and such a sense 
would be useful in many situations, such as walking in complete darkness, not 
getting run over by cars while operating a wearable computer, navigating dense 
underbrush, detecting incoming missiles.

how best to interface these electric field sensors to the human sensory 
apparatus? tactile stimulation of the face and scalp immediately jumps out as a 
360 degree spherical surface to represent the electric field of the environment. 

- weighted vibrating motors are established technology, but are bulky and 
limited in frequency response.

- piezo buzzers promise instantaneous response (no inertia) a variable frequency 
output, and compact lightweight construction.

- direct electrostimulation is even more compact and 
inexpensive, but carries complications from electrode biocompatibility, 
electrochemical leeching, and maintaining consistent contact.

Porphyropsin, a.k.a. 3,4-dehydroretinol, a.k.a. Vitamin A2

- increases human eye sensitivity to light in 850nm-950nm range to perceptible levels

- must be on vitamin A1-free diet

  - causes loss of sensitivity to blue light
