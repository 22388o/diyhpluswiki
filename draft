transhumanism is the recursive process of technological self-improvement

with the right sort of cultivation, a human's capabilities can grow in any given

we will only include those capabilities which are expected to contribute to 
further improvement. thus "the ability to fool oneself with wishful thinking" is 
not included in the list of justifications.
