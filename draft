transhumanism is the recursive process of technological self-improvement

reference extropian principles http://www.maxmore.com/extprn3.htm

with the right sort of cultivation, a human's capabilities can grow in any given 
dimension. although there exist many capabilities one may wish to improve, here 
we will only include those capabilities which are expected to contribute to 
further improvement. thus "the ability to fool oneself with wishful thinking" is 
not included in the list of justifications.

sort projects by dimension of capability, feasibility, and expected effectiveness


list of justifications, our core goals and values:

overcoming limits (increase maximum performance)
  physical strength
  perseverance
    sustained attention
  bandwidth in
    sensory awareness
    information awareness
    pattern recognition complexity-time product
  bandwidth out
    action latency
    expressiveness
    reduced time to mutual understanding

improve system resilience (increase minimum performance)
  self-sufficiency
    technology that enables technology development
  mobility
  eliminate single points of failure

improve effectiveness (increase average performance)
  signal to noise ratio (increase)
  social interaction cross section (increase)
    flattening of social hierarchies
  memory
  more useful mental models
  reduction of unnecessary pain
