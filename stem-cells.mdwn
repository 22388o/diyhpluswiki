Oct3 Oct4 Sox2 Klf4 c-Myc

It is not near as easy as it looks; somewhere in the process p53 is stochastically activated (probably via the p38MAPK pathway?) - this impairs the conversion to IPSCs. It also might be one explanation of stem cell niche decay in ageing. I suspect you have to first select your raw material very carefully. You really don't want genomic integration of any material; so you have to expose the cell to totally extrinsic factors. This, btw, I think is what the niche stellite environment does. This might also be how ellagitannins work to regenerate beta cells in experimental alloxan induced type 1 diabetes - by enhancing the niche.

This is a hot topic; and there are already some 2010 papers. I can't pay for them, so I'll have to wait. Bryan do you have access? Once u r familiar with the signalling you can figure everything out - Google: "Oct3 Oct4 Sox2 Klf4 c-Myc"

The important thing is this work can be done in a kitchen; once you can get or make the immunoflourescent antibodies to the cell surface markers.

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from somatic cells by the introduction of Oct3/4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, in mouse1, 2, 3, 4 and in human5, 6, 7, 8. The efficiency of this process, however, is low9. Pluripotency can be induced without c-Myc, but with even lower efficiency10, 11. A p53 (also known as TP53 in humans and Trp53 in mice) short-interfering RNA (siRNA) was recently shown to promote human iPS cell generation12, but the specificity and mechanisms remain to be determined. Here we report that up to 10% of transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53 became iPS cells, even without the Myc retrovirus. The p53 deletion also promoted the induction of integration-free mouse iPS cells with plasmid transfection. Furthermore, in the p53-null background, iPS cells were generated from terminally differentiated T lymphocytes. The suppression of p53 also increased the efficiency of human iPS cell generation. DNA microarray analyses identified 34 p53-regulated genes that are common in mouse and human fibroblasts. Functional analyses of these genes demonstrate that the p53â€“p21 pathway serves as a barrier not only in tumorigenicity, but also in iPS cell generation.
