# Microfluidics projects overview #

low-cost and open source microfluidic chip for DNA synthesis and probably DNA sequencing, thermocycling, cell culture, transgenics/electroporation, bubble logic, etc.

## Strategy ##

probably 2-layer PDMS with pressure valves

## Equipment ##

* mini laser cutter (1 micron beam width, approx. 1 micron step size)
* dust fan for cutting fumes
* syringe pumps
* spin coater

## Testing ##

Microfluidics are often tested by flowing dyes and fluorescent beads.

* anionic (- charge)
* cationic (+ charge)

[Indigo carmine (FD&C Blue 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_carmine)           | anionic. pH indicator, Indolesulfonic acid, Indigo carmine in a 0.2% aqueous solution is blue at pH 11.4 and yellow at 13.0. Indigo carmine is also a redox indicator, turning yellow upon reduction. | ![Blue 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indigo_carmine.svg "Blue 2")
[Fast Green FCF (FD&C Green 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Green_FCF)          | mixed cat/anionic. It is used as a quantitative stain for histones at alkaline pH after acid extraction of DNA. It is also used as a protein stain in electrophoresis. Its absorption maximum is at 625 nm. | ![Green 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Fast_Green_FCF.svg/250px-Fast_Green_FCF.svg.png "Green 3")
[Erythrosine (FD&C Red 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrosine)                  | anionic. It is the disodium salt of 2,4,5,7-tetraiodofluorescein. Its maximum absorbance is at 530 nm in an aqueous solution, and it is subject to photodegradation. | ![Red 3(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Erythrosine.svg/230px-Erythrosine.svg.png "Red 3")]
[Brilliant Blue FCF (FD&C Blue 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_Blue_FCF)   | mixed, looks mostly anionic.  It is soluble in water, and the solution has a maximum absorption at about 628 nanometers. | ![Blue 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Brilliant_Blue_FCF_structure.tif/lossy-page1-640px-Brilliant_Blue_FCF_structure.tif.jpg "Blue 1")

[Crystal Violet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_violet) | cationic? When dissolved in water, the dye has a blue-violet colour with an absorbance maximum at 590 nm and an extinction coefficient of 87,000 M−1 cm−1. The colour of the dye depends on the acidity of the solution. At a pH of 1.0, the dye is green with absorption maxima at 420 nm and 620 nm, while in a strongly acidic solution (pH of −1), the dye is yellow with an absorption maximum at 420 nm. | ![Crystal Violet](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Methyl_Violet_10B.png "Crystal Violet")
