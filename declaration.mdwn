# Introduction

An Actually Transhumanist Declaration

This is a specific version of a personal philosophy of personal human
enhancement, also known as transhumanism. It offers applied individual effort
(or hard work) as a critical missing piece of the transhumanist puzzle.

To put it lightly, transhumanists make transhumanism happen. Transhumanists
believe in directly applying existing technology to build successive levels of
transhumanist technology.

After examining other transhumanist declarations, they all seem to affirm that
technology is generally positive but they only weakly state that transhumanists
are directly responsible for achieving their goals. This declaration is
necessary because everything else doesn't even begin to successfuly describe
these important values and motivations.

# Transhumanist technology

Biology is technology. Human biology can be augmented, modified and improved
just like any other biology. Transhumanist technology tends to include devices
and methods that further enable you to make modifications, augmentations and
improvements.

If you are interested in directly building transhumanist technology, please
contact us through the ##[hplusroadmap](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/hplusroadmap)
channel on irc.freenode.net, the longest-running transhumanist channel in
existence. The channel began as a roadmapping project for transhumanist
technology for figuring out which enabling technologies (that is, technology
that begets more transhumanist technology) to build.
