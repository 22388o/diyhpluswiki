# Introduction

An Actually Transhumanist Declaration

This is a specific version of a personal philosophy of personal human
enhancement, also known as transhumanism. It offers applied individual effort
(or hard work) as a critical missing piece of the transhumanist puzzle.

To put it lightly, transhumanists make transhumanism happen. Transhumanists
believe in directly applying existing technology to building transhumanist
technologies that are either presently, nearly and long-term possible.

After examining other transhumanist declarations, they all seem to affirm that
technology is generally positive but they only weakly state that transhumanists
are directly responsible for achieving their goals. This declaration is
necessary because everything else fails to capture these shared core values and
motivations.

# Transhumanist technology

Biology is technology. Human biology can be augmented, modified and improved
just like any other biology. Transhumanist technology tends to include devices
and methods that further enable you to make modifications, augmentations and
improvements.

<div id="obvious" />
# Obvious statements

* Learn programming. This is the best way to experience the most immediate
gains in transhumanist undertakings.

* Emphasis on skills involving lab protocols for molecular biology,
microbiology, genetic engineering and bioinformatics.

* Emphasis on skills involving electronics, circuit design, chip architecture,
semiconductor/pcb manufacturing, and robotics.

* Emphasis on skills involving machine shops, including CNC machines such as
lathes, mills, laser cutters, etc.

# Proactionary Principle

The proactionary principle exists as a response to the precautionary principle,
a rule of thumb often used when deciding whether to allow the pursuit of a
technology that might have a negative consequence. In practice, the
precautionary principle is strongly biased against technological progress,
stating that "we should permit no new technology to be developed and no new
productive activity to take place unless we can scientifically prove that no
harm to health or environment will result."

Alternatively, the proactionary principle emphasizes technological progress and
our freedom to innovate and experiment, while also considering lost costs,
payoffs and negative effects. The burden of proof against developing a new
technology therefore belongs to those who propose restrictive measures.

People's freedom to innovate technologically is highly valuable, even critical,
to humanity. This implies a range of responsibilities for those considering
whether and how to restrict new technologies. Assess risks
and opportunities using an objective, open, and comprehensive, yet simple
decision process based on science rather than collective emotional reactions.
Account for the costs of restrictions and lost opportunities as fully as direct
effects. Favor measures that are proportionate to the probability and magnitude
of impacts, and that have the highest payoff relative to their costs. Give a
high priority to peopleâ€™s freedom to learn, innovate, and advance.

If you are interested in directly building transhumanist technology, please
contact us through the ##[hplusroadmap](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/hplusroadmap)
channel on irc.freenode.net, the longest-running transhumanist channel in
existence. The channel began as a roadmapping project for transhumanist
technology for figuring out which enabling technologies (that is, technology
that begets more transhumanist technology) to build.
