## Space fuel
Fenn laughs at the concept of biofuels for spacecraft.
Suggests hydrogen or or a mass driver or ion rocket.


## Lithography
Bryan links to his notes on graphene at http://heybryan.org/graphene.html
Mentions graphene and eletron beam lithography = win because it can produce microprocessors

Fenn asks: How do you make semiconductors out of graphene? In an electron microscope, the e-beam
starts out with a hot tungsten disc - that's the 'image'

Fenn: you'd have to make a mask that blocks electrons while they are still relatively 

Bryan: Another method is to use a Scanning Tunneling Microscope. Apply voltage from the tip of the STM tip. Use a $100 STM project, apply a voltage to a sheet of graphene with some sort of photoresist or etchant over it. Process is slow, but Harvard is using it. 


## Operations
Fenn wants a copy of the wiki db. Bryan can't provide it in time because his website is going down.
