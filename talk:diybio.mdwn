[[!map pages="talk:diybio/* and ! talk:diybio/*/*"]]

Currently the "normal view" formatting of the [[talk:diybio/faq]] is a wall of text, without any sections or paragraphs.
When I hit the "edit" button,
I see it is divided up nicely into paragraphs and sections.
How do I fix it so I see the paragraph and section divisions even in the normal view?
Do I need to tell ikiwiki to use "mediawiki" syntax rather than "Markdown" syntax,
and if so, how do I do that?

The mediawiki syntax plugin is not installed at the moment. The reason why the talk:diybio page has a different formatting style is because it was imported from the openwetware wiki. And then I never got around to fixing it. You are welcome to fix it, delete it, leave it alone, etc., as you please. Also, if you would like the mediawiki syntax plugin to be installed, I have bugged jrayhawk.
