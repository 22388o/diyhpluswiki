[[!map pages="talk:diybio/* and ! talk:diybio/*/*"]]

Currently the "normal view" formatting of the [[talk:diybio/faq]] is a wall of text, without any sections or paragraphs.
When I hit the "edit" button,
I see it is divided up nicely into paragraphs and sections.
How do I fix it so I see the paragraph and section divisions even in the normal view?
Do I need to tell ikiwiki to use "mediawiki" syntax rather than "Markdown" syntax,
and if so, how do I do that?
